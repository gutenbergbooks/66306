<p>In looking back over the preparation of these sketches
I feel as though each evening I'd gathered up the bits and
pieces left over from the day's work and fashioned them
into designs for my own amusement and the edification
of my family. Truly it's as though I'd used stray feathers,
fallen from the bird skins I'd handled, and fitted them together
into something of wider interest than the original.</p>

<p>Much of my work now is museum research, working
with bird specimens and books. In fashioning a research
paper I always amass a great deal more material, that is to
say, information and ideas, than I am able to use in it. In
place of a lumber room I have a set of files with index
headings that range from Abundance and Age, through
such headings as Beauty, Feathering of Feet, Fictitious,
Hysteria, Pterylography, Social, Song, Tail Feathers,
Valentine's Day, to Zoogeography. Here I put the information
that is irrelevant at the moment but too interesting to
discard. Its source is varied. Some has been accumulated
while studying specimens from localities as geographically
separated as Alaska, El Salvador, Gabon, Tristan da
Cunha, Nepal, Negros, and New Guinea; and while writing
papers that range from describing new species to discussing
secondary sexual characters and ecological competition.
Some have been recorded while in the field on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
expeditions, trips that ranged from two years in Madagascar,
three expeditions in New Guinea, and a season in
the Philippines to trips nearer home from the Yukon to
Nova Scotia, Florida, and Central America.</p>

<p>Gradually information builds up under each heading,
and new ones are added. These items are too interesting
to remain buried in the files. They are things people want
to know about. So I began to draft them into articles for
publication in the museum's monthly, <i>The Chicago Natural
History Museum Bulletin</i>. The response was gratifying.
The press picked them up and reprinted them. One was
used in a Chicago <i>Tribune</i> editorial. Several were used in
commercial radio programs. Encouraged, I prepared more,
soon overrunning the space available in the bulletin.</p>

<p>Most scientific papers are not written to be read for enjoyment.
Conciseness as well as clarity are striven for,
conveying certain information in a small compass. The
correlations made are often obscure ones, appreciated only
by scientists. Yet the material they contain is often intensely
interesting, and if these papers were written in a
more leisurely style, with more general correlations
pointed out, they would provide both interesting and entertaining
reading. In a few cases my own research falls in
this class, and I've rewritten some of my own papers with
this in mind (<i>see</i> "Battle of the Sexes and Its Evolutionary
Significance").</p>

<p>This collection of articles, if it were a painting, could be
called a conversation piece. Or it might be compared to a
well-filled whatnot. Each of the sixty chapters is an independent
unit, illustrating some facet of birds, their behavior,
or our study of them. Some of the facts may seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
unusual or bizarre, but most of them are well known and
well documented. The thing that is new, if there is anything
new, is the setting in which I've placed them, the
manner in which I've looked at them. Taken as a whole,
they touch on many different birds from many different
places in their less widely known aspects, and with a
human interest slant.</p>

<p>"But what will your professional colleagues say?" asked
a friend as he flipped through the cartoons. "These pictures
don't approach the subject in a very serious manner."
Quite true. But a discipline must be very lightly rooted
indeed if it can't stand a few caricatures and cartoons and
perhaps be the better for them.</p>

<p>The knowledge of most people about the hornbills of
tropical Africa, the gulls of Australia, the penguins of
Antarctica, and the crocodile birds of the Nile is probably
pretty vague. To give a frame of reference in a biological
sense is impractical in the compass of one slim volume.</p>

<p>But a ready-made frame of reference already exists:
the parallels in bird and in human. These I have used. But
in so doing I am not imputing human motives and attributes
to birds. The actions are similar. The workings of
the human mind I understand only vaguely; that of the
bird I can study only through the actions of the birds. One
set of behavior may be learned and rational, one rigidly
innate, entirely instinctive, and inherited, or at most modified
by experience. Be that as it may, the similarity in the
end result in two such different vertebrate animals as man
and bird when faced with similar problems is often close.
Perhaps it is because the solutions are necessarily few;
perhaps, and I incline to this feeling, it helps illustrate one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
aspect of the close relationship between all animate nature.</p>

<p>This series of articles is intended to be interesting and
entertaining. I hope it will also make more people aware
of the many ways birds act, here and in far places, how
they have solved their problems and profited by their opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">M</span>an is the tool user</span> pre-eminent in the animal world,
but he does not stand completely alone in this. Here and
there, in quite different groups of animals such as insects,
mammals, and birds, a few kinds have forged a little ahead
of the rest of their near relatives and show the very beginning
of tool using.</p>

<p>The song thrush of Europe is perhaps a borderline case.
It feeds in part on snails. To get the soft edible animal out
of its shell, it carries or drags the snail to a favorite rock,
its anvil, and there hits it against the anvil until the shell
is broken and its contents exposed. The question is, can
this be considered as using a tool? If the song thrush
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span>
moved or prepared the rock, which it does not do, there
would be no question that it was a tool. The sea otter
brings a stone from the bottom of the ocean and places it
on its floating body to use as a similar anvil in cracking
hard objects, and this undoubtedly is the use of a tool. At
the other extreme are many species of birds that beat their
prey on branch or ground, wherever they happen to be.
The song thrush is certainly an advance over that, and can,
I think, be considered as using a tool in a primitive way.</p>

<p>A few other species, too, bring shellfish to special places.
Gulls on our coasts pick up mussels and clams and, flying
over a rock or some other hard surface, drop the shellfish,
and follow it down. If the shell is broken, the dish is ready
for the gull; if the shell is not broken the gull takes the
shellfish up to a higher altitude and tries again. In places
where hard-surfaced roads are conveniently located gulls
have learned to use them as shell-breaking places, and
such roads become littered with shells.</p>

<p>Crows of more than one species also use the same
routine in breaking open shellfish, and they, too, have
learned to use special hard surfaces, such as masonry walls,
on which to drop the shellfish.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">PAINTING A BOWER</span> The satin bowerbird of Australia,
a species known to science as <i>Ptilonorhynchus
violaceus</i>, has also been considered as a case in point when
discussing the use of tools. The birds are somewhat larger
than a robin, the male glossy blue-black, the female greenish.
The male of this species constructs an elaborate
bower, presumably for courtship purposes. It makes it of
sticks and twigs, and decorates it with bright and curious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span>
objects such as shells, feathers, bits of bone, and fruits,
as do several other species of bowerbirds. But the satin
bowerbird is unique in painting the inside of its bower.
Fruit is crushed in its bill, and the bird, using its bill as
the tool or paintbrush, smears the fruit juice on the sticks
on the inside of the bower. While this is a wonderfully
strange habit, and apparently unique in the bird world, it
is doubtful if this behavior can be considered as using a
tool. If the satin bowerbird used a twig, or a wad of moss
or fiber, which it does not do, in spreading the paint, the
case would be clear.</p>

<p>The clearest case is that of the woodpecker finch of the
Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. <i>Camarhynchus pallidus</i> is its proper
name. It is one of a group of dull-colored finches restricted
to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. Before it became known that
one species used a tool, the chief claim to fame of the
group was that it, along with some other Gal&aacute;pagos Island
animals, such as the giant tortoises, had a great influence
on Darwin's thinking which resulted in his working out
the theory of evolution as set forth in his <i>Origin of Species</i>.</p>

<p>The woodpecker finch feeds largely on insects it gets by
searching and probing on the ground, and on the trunk
and leaves of trees. In searching crevices the woodpecker
finch is handicapped by its rather short, thick bill, and to
offset this, it picks up a slender, short length of stick, or the
spine of a prickly pear, and with this in its bill, pokes into
crannies. The insects, disturbed or driven out, are seized.
Sometimes the woodpecker finch digs into the tree trunk
and then gets a stick to probe with; sometimes it carries
its probe about with it, poking in crannies until prey is
disturbed. Then the stick is dropped and the food seized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span></p>

<p>We have seen how several birds are perhaps borderline
cases in using tools. They use certain special aspects of
their environment in preparing their food, and use it time
after time. It's probably instinctive behavior, but learning
is shown in the gulls and crows coming to recognize and
use a hard-surfaced road in breaking open their shellfish.
The use of a probe by the woodpecker finch is a clear and
unique case of tool using by a bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">A</span>nti-social activities</span> of humans such as those of brigands
who plunder their fellow men find their parallels in
the bird world.</p>

<p>The bald eagle is one of the best-known of the birds
that practice such brigandage. Fond of fish, and capable
of capturing it himself upon occasion, it is a common practice
for the eagle to take fish from the osprey, plunder the
osprey has just caught from the water. The osprey, with
a fresh-caught fish, flies heavily. The watching eagle
quickly overtakes the smaller, heavily laden bird and
forces it to drop its catch, then dives down and usually
catches the fish before it can strike the land or water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
Rarely does the osprey escape with its food under such an
attack. It is recorded that an eagle made several dives at
one fish-laden osprey and, when these were not successful
in making it lose its hold on the fish, the eagle dived under
the smaller bird, turned over on its back, and with talons
outstretched, snatched the fish from the grasp of the
osprey and sailed away with it, as successful a pirate as
ever sailed the seas.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">NEMESIS OF VULTURES</span> Besides taking fresh-caught
food from the osprey the bald eagle has been seen pursuing
vultures and making them disgorge their meal of
carrion. The eagle, if unsuccessful in catching the disgorged
food in the air, may land on the ground and eat it
there. We know also that the aerial flights the eagle uses
to frighten the vulture into relinquishing his food are not
idle threats, for an eagle has been seen to strike and kill
a bird that refused to disgorge.</p>

<p>Not only does our American eagle adopt such practices,
but related species in other parts of the world behave in
similar ways. The New Guinea sea eagle harries the osprey
there, and on the west coast of Africa a sea eagle robs
pelicans and cormorants of their prey.</p>

<p>Certain long-winged birds of the tropical seas, such as
<i>Fregata magnificens</i>, are known popularly as man-o'-war
birds or frigate birds, reflecting their well-known character
as pirates and tyrannical freebooters. The man-o'-war birds
get part of their food from many creatures which swarm
at the surface of the sea, but they also get much of their
food by forcing terns, cormorants, boobies, and pelicans to
deliver up their catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">- 21 -</span></p>

<p>In a tropical bay a school of small fish comes to the
surface, perhaps driven by large fish below; from far and
near terns gather, darting down to seize the fish that jump
into the air. Above them circle the frigate birds, ready to
dive down and chase and harry a successful tern until it
drops its fish and leaves its prey to the freebooter.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BOOBIES ARE VICTIMS</span> Frigate birds may sail about,
also, where a colony of nesting brown boobies is located,
waiting for the birds laden with food to return home.
When such a food-laden booby returns, the frigate bird
dashes down at it, buffets it with its wings, snaps at it with
its long, hooked bill, until the booby finally drops its fish
for the man-o'-war bird to enjoy.</p>

<p>The skua, a big, dark relative of the gull, is also known
as a pirate. Its chief food is fish but it also eats many other
foods from the sea. It rarely takes the trouble to fish for
itself but watches until some other bird, perhaps a gull or
a tern, has been successful in its hunting and then gives
chase, forcing the unfortunate hunter to relinquish its
food. Several of the skua's smaller relatives, the jaegars,
have similar habits. It is written of the pomarine jaegar
off our New England coast that they are notorious pirates
and freebooters, the highwaymen among birds that prey
on their neighbors on the fishing grounds and make them
stand and deliver. The jaegar gives chase to a tern that has
caught a fish and follows it through every twist and turn
as if the two were yoked together. Finally the harassed
tern drops its fish and the jaeger swoops down and seizes it
before it can strike the water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he toilet</span> of most birds includes wetting their feathers
in water and shaking the feathers and preening them with
the bill. This bathing probably helps remove foreign matter
from the birds' plumage and helps keep it in good
condition. In addition it is probable that in summer the
birds derive enjoyment from the coolness resulting from
the bathing. But birds bathe in cold weather as well as
warm and have been recorded doing so when the temperature
of the air was only 10 or so degrees above zero.</p>

<p>The sparrows and robins that come about a birdbath
usually hop right into the water. They squat down, fluttering
their wings, and duck their heads into the water,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
splashing and rolling it over their backs. They may become
quite drenched. Then they fly to some perch to sit and
preen and dry their soaked feathers.</p>

<p>But some birds take shower baths. During a shower in
late summer I have seen marsh hawks sitting in the rain
with wings spread, apparently enjoying the wetting the
shower gives them, and a buzzard has been recorded as
deliberately flying to an open perch in a rainstorm and
sitting there with its wings spread and sometimes shaking
them until the shower was over, when it flew to a sheltered
place.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">SPRINKLERS A BOON</span> The artificial showers of lawn
sprinklers provide an opportunity for birds about our
gardens to take a shower bath in fine weather. A robin
or a flicker may hop into the shower and squat there and
indulge in bathing antics on the wet grass. Hummingbirds
have been seen to fly into the dense spray of a lawn sprinkler
and hover there for a moment, gradually assuming a
vertical position and spreading the tail, then slowly settling
to the ground, and finally "sitting" on the grass, body
erect and tail spread out fanwise, the wings continuing
to vibrate slowly. In a few moments the bird may rise
into the air and repeat the whole performance.</p>

<p>In wet tropical forest it is probable that many of the
treetop birds bathe in the water that collects on the surface
of the leaves, pushing their way through clusters of
wet leaves and over wet surfaces of others until they are
as wet as if they had actually been bathing in water. This
is not restricted to tropical birds, for even in our latitudes
towhees have been recorded as bathing thus, and thrushes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span>
and flickers have been seen to rub themselves over the wet
grass and then go through the actions of bathing followed
by preening.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BATHING WHILE FLYING</span> Watching swifts or swallows
coursing low over the surface of a lake and occasionally
touching it leaves one with the impression sometimes
that the birds are bathing rather than picking up insect
food or drinking. With some other birds the habit of bathing
from the wing is more definite. Sometimes drongo
shrikes that are sitting up on a perch near the edge of a
pool will fly out over the water, drop directly into it with
a little splash, and then rise and fly back to their perch,
where they either repeat the performance or sit and preen
their feathers.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">POST-PRANDIAL ABLUTIONS</span> Ospreys have been
recorded as bathing while on the wing in a rather striking
manner. They have been seen flying along just above the
surface of the water, then descending into it, adopting a
sort of vertical American-eagle attitude while flapping the
wings, then rising a little, flying on, and repeating the
process. It has been suggested that the osprey is washing
its feet in this manner after finishing its meal. One observer
makes this still more definite. He says that the osprey
finishes its meal of fish on a perch in a tree and then flies
low over the lake. Dropping both its legs, the osprey drags
them through the water, flapping its wings all the time.
Then it immerses its beak and head into the water while
still flying along, apparently washing off the scales and
slime that it had gotten on itself while making its meal
of fish.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">A</span> bird's plumage</span> receives a great deal of care from the
bird that wears it. The bill is the only implement for this
grooming, and it is run through and along the feathers it
can reach, helping clean them and making sure they lie in
their proper place in the bird's dress. There are parts of the
plumage that the bird's bill obviously can't reach, as that
of the head, but ducks at least surmount this difficulty by
rubbing their head against their body.</p>

<p>Many birds have oil glands (the only external glands
that most birds have), a pair of glands just above and in
front of the root of the tail, on the back. They contain an
oily substance, and the usual explanation of its use is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span>
the secretion of these glands is used in dressing the
feathers. Certainly birds that have oil glands seem to use
them, nibbling at them as though to press out the oil,
touching them with the bill, and then rubbing the bill
through the feathers, and rubbing the head against the
oil gland.</p>

<p>The beautiful, soft, whitish bloom seen on some birds'
feathers, such as the pale gray of a male marsh hawk and
filmy appearance of some herons' plumage, is caused by
specialized feathers called "powder down." Sometimes this
powder down is scattered through the plumage; sometimes
it is in patches, such as the particularly conspicuous ones
in the herons. The tips of the powder down are continually
breaking off and sifting over the rest of the plumage,
giving it the bloom that with handling quickly rubs off.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">WALNUTS AS A COSMETIC</span> But birds sometimes rub
foreign substances over their feathers&mdash;just why we don't
know. Grackles have been known to use the acid juice of
green walnuts in preening.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania starlings have been seen to come to
walnut trees when the nuts were almost three-quarters
grown, in June, and peck a hole in the sticky hull of a nut,
clip the bill into it, undoubtedly wetting the bill against
the pulpy interior, and then thrust the bill into their
plumage.</p>

<p>They did this from June to August, especially on hot,
dry summer days, but some birds continued this even during
light rain. Some years before the above was recorded,
when this sort of thing was less known, Edward Howe
Forbush, noted ornithologist, cautiously used a similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span>
record in his classical <i>Birds of Massachusetts and Other
New England States</i>. He writes that his colleague, J. N.
Baskett, says he saw a bluejay lift its wing and rub
pungent walnut leaves repeatedly into the feathers beneath.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BEER AND MOTH BALLS</span> Since then such things have
been recorded a number of times, including a catbird that
anointed its feathers with a leaf and a grackle that found
a moth ball and, holding this in its bill, rubbed it against
the underside of its spread wing and the side of its body.
After several applications the grackle dropped the moth
ball and preened its feathers; then again it picked up the
moth ball and treated the other wing as well as its belly.</p>

<p>Recent experiments with tame song sparrows have
shown that they may use beer, orange juice, vinegar, and
other things made available to them in dressing their
plumage, and it appears that this may be correlated with
a little-understood type of activity known as anting, in
which live ants are placed on the feathers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>n spring</span> and fall many of our birds make long journeys
under their own power, some of the most publicized being
the migration of the Arctic tern, a bird that may spend the
northern summer north of the Arctic Circle and, before
returning there next season, may have visited south of the
Antarctic Circle. The golden plover that makes a nonstop
flight to Hawaii is another famous traveler, and many of
our smaller songbirds are no mean travelers either. The
barn swallow that nests about an Illinois farm in the summer
may spend the winter in Argentina. The tiny hummingbirds'
feat of crossing the Gulf of Mexico nonstop is
worthy of mention too. Such travels have become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">- 29 -</span>
commonplace through familiarity. We have come to accept
even the possibility of occasional transatlantic passages of
small perching birds, helped by transatlantic vessels, and
of such birds as starlings, making their way from place to
place by boxcar.</p>

<p>But when it is time for birds to make their nests and
rear their family we expect them to give up their traveling
for a time and to settle down in one place. We expect, with
our songbirds, to have the male arrive first, pick out a
territory, and announce to his species that other males
are to keep out and that a mate is welcome. The female
arrives and chooses her mate or territory, and a nesting
ensues. Many species defend the area around the nest
against others of their kind. So it comes as a surprise to
find nests built in such a situation that they are not
stationary but move back and forth, along with part of
their environment.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BY BOAT</span> Tree swallows nest on the ferryboats that ply
between Ogdensburg, New York, and Prescott, Ontario,
across the St. Lawrence River where it is more than a mile
wide. The nests are tucked into suitable openings on the
ferries, and the frequent trips back and forth across this
mile of water and the docking at different piers do not
seem to disturb the birds. They gather their nesting material
of feathers and straws and leaves from either shore,
and when the young are being fed, insects may be gathered
about the Canadian or the United States shore, depending
on where the ferryboat is docked.</p>

<p>Another example comes from Western Australia, also
of a swallow, the welcome swallow which is nearly like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
our barn swallow. A pair of these birds nested on a boat
used for visiting local coastal stations. If there were eggs
or young in the nest when the boat sailed, the old birds
would accompany it, once following her on a trip of thirty-five
miles and back.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BY TRAIN</span> Barn swallows have been noted nesting on
railway trains that run across the two-mile portage between
Atlin Lake and Lake Tagish in British Columbia.
In the summer the train makes the trip almost daily, and
for many years a pair, or a succession of pairs, has made its
nest and raised its young in one of the open baggage cars.
Members of the train crew took an interest in the birds
and put up a cigar box for a safe place for their nest. Here
the family seemed to prosper, undisturbed by the proximity
of people and baggage and the clatter as well as the
movement of the train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>hrough selection</span> birds have become adapted to their
environment. In most cases this is successful adaptation.
Occasionally, however, we come across instances in which
the adaptations do not work out. Such cases, where the
actions of the birds are not beneficial or are even detrimental
to it, come as surprises.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the Tartarian honeysuckle
(<i>Lonicera tatarica</i>) into the United States from Asia, its
planting as an ornamental shrub provides each autumn a
display of juicy red fruit. This fruit contains saponin, a
substance that has the effect of an anesthetic and muscle
poison and may paralyze the greater nerve centers (in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span>
sufficiently large doses saponin causes death by cardiac
paralysis). A condition of intoxication has been recorded
for robins feeding extensively on these honeysuckle berries:
"... this drunkenness has been seen in every shade
of severity, from mild unsteadiness to a degree of incoordination
sufficient to cause the birds to fall to the ground.
It seems to make some of the birds utterly fearless and perhaps
a bit belligerent, for they become quite unafraid of
passers-by and interested spectators. A few dead robins
have been found about these honeysuckle bushes&mdash;presumably
poisoned by the berry diet." Fortunately the
poisoning of birds by this honeysuckle seems to be uncommon.</p>

<p>In the Philippines the local people gather the juice of
the coconut inflorescence in bamboo tubes placed in the
crowns of the palms. This juice ferments quickly and provides
a refreshing, mildly intoxicating drink. A little parrot
of the Philippines, the hanging parakeet, has a taste for
this drink, comes and drinks from the containers, sometimes
becomes drunk, falls in, and drowns.</p>

<p>The California woodpecker ordinarily differs from many
birds because it does not lead a hand-to-mouth existence
but stores food. These woodpeckers feed extensively on
acorns, and one way they store them is by drilling holes in
the bark of a tree and fitting an acorn into each hole. The
whole trunk of a tree thus may be pitted with stored
acorns. When the acorn crop fails and the nuts are scarce
the woodpecker goes through the same storage activities
but, being unable to find sufficient acorns, it stores pebbles
instead. These pebbles are, of course, quite useless to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">- 33 -</span>
woodpecker, and this is an interesting example of an instinct
"gone wrong."</p>

<p>Sometimes these woodpeckers have another method of
storing their acorns. This is by dropping them into cavities
in tree trunks, but when stored in such a way there seems
to be no way for the birds to reach them. Here again we
have a blind impulse to store acting in such a way that
the bird gains nothing by the act.</p>

<p>The raven is ordinarily and quite correctly considered
one of the most intelligent of birds, but a raven I kept in
captivity and fed small fish attempted to store some of
them by pushing them through a knothole in the back of
its cage. The fish fell about fifteen inches below the knothole,
where the raven could not possibly reach them. After
pushing each fish through the raven peered through the
knothole though it could not see the fish. Here again we
have the instinctive storing act carried out in such a way
that it produced no benefit to the bird.</p>

<p>The late George Latimer Bates, noted ornithologist,
studying the birds of West Africa, found a most surprising
thing in connection with one of the honey-guides. As a
group, these birds are noted for the habit of attracting the
attention of human beings and leading them to bee trees,
presumably so that they will break down the bee tree for
the honey, and the birds can feed on the scraps left over.
Bates found that the West African species is parasitic on
other birds in its nesting habits and its young have been
found in the nesting hole of a little barbet. This barbet was
a much smaller bird than the honey-guide and the entrance
to the nest hole was so small that Bates doubted
that the honey-guide would have been able to get in to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">- 34 -</span>
lay its egg. He suggested that the egg may have been laid
elsewhere and deposited in the nest by the parent's bill. It
is difficult to understand how the young honey-guide
would be able to get out, for when fully fledged it would
have been far too large to squeeze through the entrance
that admitted the tiny body of its foster parents, the
barbets. This is an almost incredible story and if true looks
like a case of maladaptation.</p>

steals away singly to lay its eggs and incubate them in its
nest on the ground. But occasionally it happens, Audubon
writes, that several hen turkeys associate together and lay
their eggs in one nest, and raise their young together. With
the turkey apparently there is little division of labor, as
Audubon writes of finding three hens sitting on forty-two
eggs, but he says that one of the hens is always on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span>
watch at the nest so that natural enemies have no chance
to rob it.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">A GREGARIOUS BIRD</span> What is of only occasional occurrence
in one species may be the regular course of
events in another, and in the ani we find it customary for
a number of birds to nest together. The anis are moderate-sized
cuckoos living in the tropical Americas. The smooth-billed
ani is perhaps the best known, for Dr. D. E. Davis,
when studying at Harvard for his doctor's degree, made a
special trip to Cuba to study them in the field. The smooth-billed
ani goes in flocks the year round. Usually there are
about seven birds in the flock, but there may be as many
as twenty-four. The nest is a bulky structure of twigs and
fresh leaves. When nest building starts usually one bird is
most active, but as many as five birds were seen carrying
in sticks at one time. When the nest of sticks and leaves is
finished several females may lay their eggs in it. But apparently
only one bird incubates at a time, and the male
takes his turn at incubating. When the young hatch, after
about thirteen days, most of the adults in the colony help
feed the young.</p>

<p>Eider ducks may nest in dense colonies, but each bird
has its own nest in which it lays its own eggs, and in which
the female alone incubates. But after the young hatch and
the mother leads them to the water, the young may band
into larger flocks, accompanied by a number of females,
and the young seem to be independent of their particular
parent, but attach themselves to and are tended by the
nearest duck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">- 37 -</span></p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">PENGUIN SOCIAL GROUPS</span> A much more elaborate
system for caring for the young has been evolved by certain
penguins. The sexes alternate in their care of the
young in the early stages. But when the young are partly
grown the family unity breaks up for a communistic type
of social organization. The young are now grouped into
bands of up to twenty or more birds and are left under the
care of a few old birds, while the rest of the adults go to
the water, which may be some distance away. Periodically
they return with food for the young. Apparently the individual
young is not recognized by the parent, which goes
to the particular group of which its young is a part, and
there may feed any one of the "child groups."</p>

<p>Here we have two definite cases of a social organization
that has resulted in division of labor: in the incubation of
the ani, and in the care of young penguins. In addition we
have two less specialized cases of the same thing, showing
the sort of raw material on which evolution can operate to
produce new behavior patterns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>n caves</span> near the ocean in the Far East nest myriads of
tiny swiftlets whose chief impact on the civilized world is
that their nests provide an edible article of commerce.
"Birds' nest soup" at once comes to the mind of the Occidental,
few of whom have ever eaten of the nests, or even
seen the birds to know them. For those who would like to
see the nests, some museums have them on exhibition,
such as in the Chicago Natural History Museum, where
two nests are placed in their natural setting, and beside
them is a quantity of the material of commerce in its raw
state.</p>

<p>The birds themselves are dusky-colored swifts only a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">- 39 -</span>
few inches long, and belong to a group of swifts that represents
perhaps the most puzzling problems of species
identification in the bird world. As yet we do not know
even how many species there are. The genus is called
<i>Collocalia</i>. Only some of its members make the edible
nests; others mix so much moss into the nest that it is useless
for soup. One species has the scientific name of <i>esculenta</i>,
given in reference to the supposed edible nature of
the nest, but through error the name was applied to a
species whose nests are not edible. In habits all these
swiftlets seem very similar, flying about with a rather weak
flight for a swift, catching their insect food on the wing.</p>

<p>A number of swifts, including our chimney swift, use
the secretion of their salivary glands as a glue to stick together
their nest, and to stick it to the wall of a cave, the
inside of a hollow tree, or the inside of a chimney. But
some of the edible-nest swifts go further and make their
nest entirely of this secretion from their enormously enlarged
salivary glands. This material, as it comes from the
mouth of the bird, resembles a saturated solution of gum
arabic and is very viscid. If one draws out a strand from
the mouth of the bird and sticks it on a rod, by rotating the
rod and winding up on it the thread of saliva one can
empty the salivary glands of the bird. This material dries
quickly, and is the material of which the nest is made.
When the bird makes its nest, which it does in large
colonies in caves, it flies up to the rock wall, applies the
saliva to the rock in a semicircle or horseshoe. Gradually
a little shelf is built out, and in the finished nest one can
see the many little strands that have gone into the structure.
It may take the birds as long as three months to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span>
this nest, even if undisturbed. The birds lay their two eggs
in the nest, and raise their naked, helpless hatchlings into
facsimiles of themselves in it.</p>

<p>But in the Orient, especially in China, the nests are
highly prized by epicures as a delicacy. As the supply is
limited the price is high. A note with some material we
saw stated that the price was $12 to $36 a pound in Siam.</p>

<p>The climbing for and collecting of these nests requires
daring, skill and is not without danger. The nests may be
far back and high up in the cave. Ropes and poles may
have to be fixed in place to aid the climber, who has a
flaming torch in one hand and carries a sack or basket for
the nests. In Siam, at least, the collecting of these nests
was hereditary, father training son. The rights to collect
nests are valuable. In Siam, where the rights to collecting
the nests were vested in the state, revenue of as high as
&pound;20,000 has been received from the rights for this collection.</p>

<p>The nests are said to be of highly nitrogenous material,
and contain about 50 per cent of protein and 7&frac12; per cent
of mineral matter. Their use as food is an Oriental custom,
but an Occidental opinion of their flavor is that it is bland,
and an appreciation of it needs to be cultivated. The price
of these nests is so great that unscrupulous persons have
manufactured spurious nests. These nests are made from
agar-agar, the jelly made by boiling down certain seaweed,
and are so cleverly flavored that only connoisseurs can detect
the fraud.</p>

<p>We usually think of these nests in connection with
birds'-nest soup, which may be made with chicken or beef
broth and then the cleaned material of the nest added like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">- 41 -</span>
tapioca or vermicelli. Sometimes a sweet soup is made.
Sometimes lotus seeds, sugar, and the nest material are
used in the preparation of the dish. But in the Orient, at
least formerly, they're considered to have medicinal qualities,
too. It is said that when combined with ginseng they
are capable of restoring life to a person on the point of
death. In Northern China where the winter is bitterly
cold, it is a general belief that the blood congeals and can
only be thawed out by drinking a soup made of these nests.
The list of further benefits, such as against tuberculosis, as
a tonic, stimulant, and a pacifier of the stomach, recall
advertisements of patent medicines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">F</span>or long</span> it has been written that the male hornbill
walled up his mate in her nest in a hole in a tree at nesting
time, and one author even wrote that the male plucked
out the female's feathers at this time. The facts underlying
these statements have different interpretations, but the
nesting of the hornbill is still one of the most extraordinary
of animal habits. Travelers and naturalists in Africa had
brought back tantalizing bits of information, to add piecemeal
to our knowledge of these birds. Now all this is synthesized
and corrected by R. E. Moreau, onetime resident
in East Africa, who made a study of certain species, raised
young birds by hand, and gave us a comparative study of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">- 43 -</span>
their behavior. Even this study must be considered preliminary,
for, of the twenty-six African species, we have
breeding data on only sixteen of them.</p>

<p>First we must not generalize too far as to "the hornbills,"
for there are Asiatic and Malayan species as well as
African, and African species differ among themselves, the
ground hornbill being especially aberrant in its habits.</p>

<p>It is quite true that in many African species the female
is walled up in her nest, and the period when she is enclosed
may last three to four months. But it cannot be
interpreted as an imprisonment forced on her by the male,
and presumably she could, if she wanted to, open the entrance
at any time, as she does finally on emerging.</p>

<p>Among the African species the details vary, but the nest
is usually located in a hole in a tree, and except in the case
of the ground hornbill the entrance is plastered up so that
only a narrow slit is left, about wide enough for the passage
of the bird's bill. The female takes an active part in
the walling up of the opening, and might be said to wall
herself in. When the opening to be filled in is wide, the
male may bring earth, which he mixes with saliva in his
gullet, and presents to the female, who does the actual
plastering. In some species the walling up of the entrance
may take months.</p>

<p>The female may wall herself in some days before she
lays her first egg. Throughout incubation she remains
there. Depending on the species, she may peck her way
out, or burst out when the young are partly grown, or she
may stay until the young are ready to fly.</p>

<p>During the time the female is walled in the male brings
food for her, and later for the young, also. That he is a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">- 44 -</span>
provider is indicated by the fatness of the female and her
young. This is proverbial with the natives of Africa. The
method of feeding varies with the species. The male may
bring a bit of food in its bill, pass it in to the female, and
then go for another, or in other species we might think
more intelligent, the male carries a quantity of berries in
its gullet, and these are regurgitated one by one and
passed to the waiting female; such species make trips to
the nest less frequently.</p>

<p>Apparently shortly after the female goes into the retirement
of her walled-in nest, she molts all her flight feathers,
so that she is flightless, and then begins to grow them
again.</p>

<p>When the female bursts out of the nest with the young
only partly grown, the young that remain in a still very
undeveloped state in the nest, using material in the nest
such as remains of food and rotten wood, replaster the
hole! The young, perhaps only halfway through their
fledgling period, wall themselves in! The female then
helps the male care for the young.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of what some of the African hornbills
do at nesting time. The habit is unique in the bird world.
One species appears not to wall up its nest. In an Asiatic
species it is said that if the male is killed other hornbills
help to feed the female in retirement. The whole procedure
is an amazing behavior pattern, and one for the
development of which it is difficult to find a functional
explanation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he crocodile bird</span>, or Egyptian plover, has enjoyed a
dubious publicity because of its reputed habit of entering,
and coming out of, crocodile mouths. As Herodotus put it,
the crocodile's mouth is infested with leeches, and when
the crocodile comes out of the water it lies with its mouth
open facing the western breeze. Then the crocodile bird
goes into the crocodile's mouth and devours the leeches, to
the gratification of the crocodile, who is careful not to
harm the bird. Though there are some more recent observations
corroborating this, modern observers who have
had abundant opportunity have watched for this behavior
and have not seen it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">- 46 -</span></p>

<p>As one authority on African birds puts it, it is evidently
not an everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>But the crocodile bird has other habits that are just as
bizarre and interesting. It lives along the sandy shores of
African rivers, and when it lays its clutch of two to four
eggs these are buried in the sand so there is no sign of
them aboveground. The bird sits on top of this spot.
A. L. Butler, who studied this bird in the Sudan, thought
that the sand might be scraped away from the eggs and
the eggs brooded in normal fashion by night. The young
birds are very precocial, and feed themselves on tiny insects,
but they follow the parent. When danger threatens
the young squat motionless in some depression. The toe
mark of a hippopotamus is a favorite place. Then the old
bird, with her bill, throws sand over the young until they
may be completely covered. Not only does this happen
when the birds are very small, but continues up until the
time the birds can fly. Dr. W. Serle in Sierra Leone once
saw a crocodile bird burying something and found the disturbed
spot fairly easily, as recent rain had beaten the sand
beach smooth and hard; a fully fledged young was unearthed.
It squatted motionless until prodded from behind,
then it ran swiftly, rose, and flew away strongly.</p>

<p>The burying is not only protection from immediate
enemies; A. L. Butler believed it was normal for the young
when not feeding to be buried for safety or as protection
from the burning sun. For a further protection from the
sun the parent moistens the sand by regurgitating water
over it.</p>

<p>Butler on one occasion saw a crocodile bird drink at the
water's edge, run up onto a sand beach, regurgitate water,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">- 47 -</span>
then settle to brood. Butler marked the spot, went to it,
and, scraping away the dampened sand, found a tiny chick
about one inch below the surface.</p>

<p>This covering of the eggs by the parent is not unique in
the bird world. The pied-billed grebe of North America
also does this. When disturbed at the nest the incubating
bird has been seen to use quick pecking motions to draw
material from the edge of the nest over the eggs. Instead
of leaving the eggs exposed the nest simply looks like a
heap of trash and may thus escape the attention of a
predator. It used to be thought that this grebe used to
incubate only at night, leaving the eggs covered during
the day to be incubated by the heat from the sun and from
the decaying vegetation of the nest. However, recent
studies have shown this is not the case, and protection by
concealment seems to be the main advantage of this behavior.</p>

<p>Yet another species of quite a different group, the eider
duck, covers its eggs on leaving them. The eider's nest is
characterized by a blanket of down, plucked from the
breast of the bird, and when the female has time, when
she leaves the nest she pulls the edges of the down blanket
over the eggs, perhaps for concealment, perhaps for the
sake of the down's insulating properties, keeping the eggs
warm in a northern climate during the parent's absence.</p>

<p>Here we have covering of eggs for what seems to be very
different purposes: to keep the eggs cool; to keep them
warm; and to hide them from view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">A</span>ngus Gavin</span> was a fur trader at the Perry River post of
the Hudson's Bay Company on the edge of the Arctic
Ocean. White foxes were the chief fur brought in, and the
Eskimos were the trappers. Sometimes it was necessary to
advance credit to an Eskimo, against the expectation of a
coming season's catch out of which the advance was to be
repaid. Gavin, who was a keen naturalist as well as trader,
writes, "I used my observation on Snowy Owl abundance
to govern extension of credit...." When snowy owls
were abundant he could extend liberal credit to the
Eskimo with every assurance the white-fox catch would be
good and that the Eskimo would be able to liquidate his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">- 49 -</span>
debt. When snowy owls were scarce little credit would be
extended, for the white-fox catch would be small.</p>

<p>In general we've accepted the value of birds to man, and
are appreciative of the complicated web of life in which
one animal affects many others. But this use of snowy-owl
abundance as a guide in granting credit strikes me as
novel. Actually, of course, it is quite sound, for it uses one
part of the chain that links such diverse items as owls,
lemmings, foxes, Eskimo, fur trader, and finally of course
milady in her white-fox furs.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">LEMMINGS IMPORTANT</span> First of the factors involved
is, of course, the vegetation; the grasses, herbs, and
tiny dwarf shrubs of the Arctic barrens. The next are the
lemmings, mouselike creatures of the Far North that eat
the vegetation. They are the first step in turning grass into
flesh and fur and feathers. One of the striking facts of
lemming biology is the fluctuation in their numbers. Some
years they swarm, lemmings are everywhere, and in places
they erupt in vast emigration, the tundra and the sea ice
being covered with masses of moving lemmings. We know
this best from the accounts written about the lemmings of
Norway, but the same thing occurs in the American Arctic.
At other times they're scarce and it is difficult to find even
one. Strangely there's a periodicity in this, and periods of
abundance and scarcity tend to recur every four years.
What happens or what causes it we don't know.</p>

<p>The Arctic fox, staple fur bearer of the Far North, and
the snowy owl both prey on lemmings. Lemmings are so
important to them that when lemmings are abundant the
foxes and the owls prosper and multiply; when the lemmings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">- 50 -</span>
are scarce the foxes and the owls starve or migrate,
in any case where there are few lemmings there are few
foxes or owls.</p>

<p>Thus we see how it is that an abundance of snowy owls
can indicate that the Eskimo will make a good fox catch
and the trader will do good business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">B</span>irds get</span> their everyday names in a variety of ways in the
countries where they live; from their looks, like the snake
birds and the pond scroggins; from their color, like the
cardinal and the blackbird; from their behavior, like the
frigate bird and the creepers and the boobies and king-birds;
from what they eat, or are supposed to eat, like the
antbirds and plantain eaters and bee eaters; from what
they say, like the poor-will and the more-pork; from how
they say it, like the warblers and the screamers; from how
often they say it, like the brain-fever bird and the wideawake
terns; from where they nest, like the cliff swallow
and the house martin and the chimney swift; and some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
from their non-bird associates, like the cowbird, moose-bird,
and the monkey bird.</p>

<p>It is the monkey birds that have taken our fancy at the
moment. The forests of Africa, the jungles of Borneo, and
the forests of the Philippine Islands each have a bird that
associates so often with monkeys that this habit became
incorporated into its local name. The birds are not at all
closely related. One is a hornbill, one is a drongo shrike,
and one is the fairy bluebird. The hornbill goes in parties
of their own kind, but apparently the drongo, and certainly
the fairy bluebird prefer the society of monkeys to
that of their own kind.</p>

<p>The stories we have of them stress the utilitarian aspect
of the association; that the monkeys as they travel about
through the trees scare insects out of their hiding places
and the birds, being on hand, can snap up the insects more
easily than if they had to search them out for themselves.</p>

<p>The monkey bird in Africa, which is a hornbill, follows,
along below the monkeys in the lower branches of the
trees. It used to be thought this was for the fruit the
monkeys dropped, but then it was found the hornbills were
insectivorous. Instead of being scavengers the hornbills
are using the monkeys to beat out their game for them.</p>

<p>Hamba Kerah, the slave of the monkeys, is what the
Malays of Borneo call the racket-tailed drongo. This is
from its habit of stationing itself behind a band of monkeys
traveling through the forest. But Mr. Ridley, who watched
them, decided it was the other way around; the monkeys,
unwittingly of course, were working for the drongo, acting
as beaters to drive out the insects which the bird snapped
up in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">- 53 -</span></p>

<p>In the Philippines it is "the sentinel of the monkey"
that is applied to the fairy bluebird. The bluebird seldom
associates with its own kind, but is almost invariably associated
with a band of crab-eating macaques. But here
again it seems the monkeys are acting as beaters for the
bird, driving out insects.</p>

<p>This is a sort of unconscious co-operation one finds in
the bird world. One animal helps out another without being
aware of it. Birds are ever ready to profit by such behavior,
and when it proves of enough benefit, the habit
can become usual for the species, as in the cowbird-cow
relationship, or indispensable as with the oxpecker-hoofed-animal
association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>ncubators</span> as we know them on chicken farms are electrical
gadgets with thermostats to control the temperature,
or at least with oil lamps to supply the heat necessary for
the young chick in the egg to grow. Naturally we wouldn't
expect anything so artificial as this in the bird world, but
there is one group of birds that does not brood its eggs but
has employed another method of incubating.</p>

<p>The birds that do this are fowl-like birds of the Australasian
area. They are variously called "mound builders"
from the nest mound they construct, "megapodes" from
the large size of their scratching feet, or bush turkeys, presumably
from their edible qualities. These birds bury their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">- 55 -</span>
eggs and leave them thus to hatch without any brooding
by the bird. The birds have adapted their habits to two
different sources of natural heat. On some of the Pacific
islands there is local volcanism making the sand warm. To
such places the birds come to bury their eggs.</p>

<p>But in many of the tropical forests there is not this convenient
natural heat. Another method is employed. The
birds take advantage of the heat generated by rotting vegetation.
They scratch up the surface litter of the forest floor
into mounds&mdash;structures that may be a yard or two high
and five or six yards across. Some much larger have been
observed. It is into these the hens burrow and lay their
eggs. The temperatures in them have been recorded as
95&deg; to 96&deg; F., which compares with normal bird temperatures
of just over 100&deg; (bird temperatures are a few degrees
higher than normal human temperature).</p>

<p>The bush turkeys from Queensland have been bred in
captivity, and have given some extremely interesting data,
according to an article by Mr. Coles in the proceedings of
the Zoological Society of London for 1937. It was the male
who did all the building of the mound. Though the female
started to cover the eggs laid singly in burrows in the
mound, the male finished this. And it was the male that
looked after the nest mound during the incubation period,
continually scratching over the surface layer. Both parents
helped the young emerge, by digging burrows into the
mound which the emerging young, who had started to
burrow out, could use.</p>

<p>The young are in a very advanced state and apparently
are able to fly and look after themselves upon emerging.
On the day after hatching one chick is reported as able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
flutter up to a perch six feet high. In the captive birds
mentioned above, the parents, though they were attending
to the mound and helped the chick out, appeared to take
no further interest in the chick once it was out.</p>

<p>There are a few other cases when birds cover or bury
their eggs. With the grebes it has been said they covered
them and left them to be incubated, but that is doubtful.
Certainly the megapodes are the only ones to present a
dear case of "artificial" incubation.</p>

<p>This burying of eggs by the megapodes of course brings
to mind the way some reptiles, such as turtles, bury their
eggs. And considering that from an evolutionary viewpoint
birds are really only modified reptiles, it is perhaps
not surprising that they too have this habit. But that it is
really an ancestral trait retained by the megapodes is
doubtful. Rather I'm inclined to think it's another example
of the many ways birds have evolved, or changed
their habits so as to utilize as much of the environment as
they can in as many ways as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>n western Europe</span>, when falconry was in favor for taking
game on land and in the air, there was a certain vogue
for training cormorants to take fish. Like the falcons, the
cormorants were hooded and carried on the wrist, but of
course where the falcons flew to their game, the cormorants
swam to theirs.</p>

<p>It was in China where cormorants were domesticated,
"completely and perfectly," as that eminent Sinologist Dr.
Laufer says. Extensive breeding establishments have been
maintained. The eggs of the breeding flock of cormorants
are given to a hen to hatch, for cormorants as mothers
prove unsatisfactory under domestication. When the eggs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
hatch the young cormorants must have special care; for,
unlike the young of ducks and geese, young cormorants at
hatching are not down-covered and able to run about, but
are weak, helpless things sensitive to cold. They are placed
in cotton batting, artificial heat provided when necessary,
and they are fed by hand on a diet composed basically of
chopped eel.</p>

<p>Finally the young are full grown and fully feathered.
The training is now started. First the young are tied to a
stake at the water's edge. A whistle signal is given and the
young cormorant is pushed into the water. Thus he learns
to know and obey the signal to go into the water. Then the
trainer throws him little fish. These the cormorant catches
in its beak and when he does the trainer whistles another
signal, to bring the bird back to him with the fish. And the
cord tied to the bird is used to demonstrate what is meant
and make sure its done. So the training goes on until the
bird has graduated to a class taught from a boat. Sometimes
a small float is attached to the cormorant by a short
cord, and it can be drawn in with a bamboo hook. If young
birds are trained in the company of trained birds, it takes
but half as long. Finally the training is complete and the
fisherman sets out with his birds. This is no sporting event;
it is the serious business of life, getting a living from fishing.
On the sampan or the bamboo raft there may be from
two to a dozen birds; sometimes they may have special
perches built for them along each side of the boat. Sometimes
the cormorant has a cord or band around its neck.
The reason for this is disputed. Some say its a place to attach
a cord; a place to get hold of the bird; some say each
man's cormorant is thus specially marked for identification;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
some that it's to prevent the bird from swallowing
its prey. With well-trained cormorants it is sometimes dispensed
with. At a signal the cormorants go into the water,
swim, and dive seeking fish. The fisherman, by stamping
his feet, by voice or whistle, and by hitting the water with
a bamboo directs and encourages the birds. When the
cormorant catches a fish it brings it back to the boat, and
the fisherman may use a net, or may lift up the cormorant
onto the boat on an oar or pole, and take the fish from the
bird. If a bird is lazy it's encouraged by beating the water
near it with a bamboo pole. As cormorants' plumage is
only partly waterproof they cannot stay in the water indefinitely,
and this, as well as fatigue, probably determines
the rest periods when the birds are lifted aboard. Sometimes
the fisherman helps attract fish to the boat for the
cormorants to catch by scattering grains of rice in the
water.</p>

<p>When the day is finished the cormorants are collected,
fed, and the fisherman goes home with the sustenance for
his family, gathered by a bird.</p>

<p>In Japan the cormorant is also used, but apparently
somewhat differently. There cormorant fishing may partake
of the nature of a sport. Sometimes the cormorants
are "harnessed" into a team, each attached by a cord to a
single line, directed by one master. In China the fishing is
usually done during the day, but in Japan night fishing is
common, the scene being illuminated by fires in braziers
or cressets on the boat, or lanterns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">O</span>ur northern shrike</span> is a songbird which has developed
feeding habits along the lines of those of a hawk. Whereas
most birds its size are content with fruits, seeds, or insects
of a size it can beat or bite and then swallow whole, our
northern shrike takes not only small insects but prefers
large ones, and mice and birds too big to be swallowed
whole. It is an opportunist and takes what is most abundant
and easily accessible. The shrike's strong hooked bill
is a powerful weapon, used with a nipping motion that is
directed at the back of the head or neck of mouse or bird.</p>

<p>Now with the dead sparrow or mouse the shrike is at a
disadvantage. With a powerful bill hooked at the tip its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
feet are still those of a songbird and are not strong enough
to hold its large prey while pulling it to pieces. Only small
insects are held in one foot and pulled to pieces. To meet
this need for holding large dead prey the impaling habit
was evolved. The result of this is the so-called larders,
which form a fancied resemblance to meat hanging in a
butcher shop, and have given the birds their name of
butcherbird. A thorn tree, a splintered end of a branch, or
even the barbs of wire fencing may serve. The shrike flies
to one of these, carrying the prey in its bill (rarely in its
feet), and with a pulling motion fixes the prey on a projection
point. Sometimes instead of impaling the mouse or
bird it pulls it into the fork of a branch, and so wedges it
there. Now the food is firmly held, and the shrike can use
its bill effectively to pull off pieces of flesh and swallow
them. When the bird has fed, it leaves the rest of the
animal hanging where it was. It may return to this food
and make repeated meals of it if not spoiled, or dried up,
until the whole is devoured. But often parts of meals are
left hanging and discarded. If suitable thorn bushes are
scarce the shrike may return time after time to the same
tree with its prey, and in time this tree may come to be
decked with many partly devoured carcasses. Such trees
are the so-called "larders." There is another aspect of
shrike behavior that adds to these larders. The shrike, even
when replete, may seize any prey that appears and impale
it. The bird's organization is such that the sight of a small
moving animal may start the actions that end with impalement
even when the bird is not hungry. This food usually
is not eaten later.</p>

<p>Thus the shrike's "butcher shop" is not primarily a store
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
of food, even though it sometimes serves as such when
in times of scarcity remains of old meals are eaten. It is
not a gathering of food in time of plenty and saving it for
a later use. Rather the placing of many items in one tree
is the result of its being a favorable impaling place. And
the impaling is behavior developed to overcome the weakness
of the claws in a bird whose disposition and strong
beak enable it to prey habitually on larger animals which
otherwise it could not tear to pieces and eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">P</span>articularly</span> in the study of insects it has been shown
that bright or contrasting and conspicuous colors tend to
be associated with ill-flavor in the animals that wear them,
while insects with a good flavor tend to be so colored that
they are difficult to see. The first is a warning coloration&mdash;advertising
to a predator that he will not enjoy eating this
insect and better leave it alone; the other is concealing
color, its function apparently to keep predators from finding
their prey. The tasters in the experiments that have
been used to work out the above generalizations were
usually birds, but, as checks, a variety of other animals
were used, and the magpie moth (<i>Abraxas grossulariata</i>),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
for instance, was found to be distasteful to certain spiders,
frogs, lizards, various birds, a bat, and finally "the late
Dr. Hans Gadow (one of the leading ornithologists of his
day), who made a practice of sampling caterpillars, remarked
on trying an <i>A. grossulariata</i> that it was quite one
of the worst he had ever eaten!" Apparently ideas in
taste are similar throughout large sections of the predatory
animal world. Reversing the usual role, and using insects
(hornets) as tasters of bird flesh, the celebrated British
naturalist, Dr. H. B. Cott, has recently studied the question
of the palatability in birds and their coloration.
Naturally Dr. Cott, with his customary thoroughness,
compared hornets as tasters with other animals, including
cats and men, and found a surprisingly close agreement
in the results.</p>

<p>The experimental procedure was to expose the flesh of
two different birds (without feathers) at the same time,
and see which the wasps ate first. Thus a graded series
was built up of the 38 species of birds tested, with a
palatability rating of from 1 to 38. The wryneck and the
crested lark stood at the top of the list, and the pied kingfisher
and the white-rumped black chat, as the least palatable,
at the bottom with Numbers 37 and 38.</p>

<p>Then, surveying the coloration of the birds, and their
habits, Dr. Cott made the important correlation that in
general the birds whose flesh was most edible were protectively
colored, and those whose flesh was least palatable
tended to be conspicuous in color and behavior!</p>

<p>To relate it to the theory of evolution Cott concludes
that selective pressure by predators seems to have forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">- 65 -</span>
vulnerable species along two divergent lines of specialization:
leading in those which are relatively palatable
toward concealment, and in those which are relatively
distasteful toward advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he question</span> as to the number of feathers on a bird
seems a simple one without complication. Dr. Wetmore,
the well-known ornithologist who was secretary of the
Smithsonian Institute, has given us some data. The number
varies with the species, of course: the smallest bird, a hummingbird
from Cuba, had the fewest, 940 feathers; larger
birds had more, the robin 2587, and the mourning dove
2635 feathers. A glaucous-winged gull had 6540; a mallard
11,903 feathers; a Plymouth Rock chicken was said to have
8325 feathers; and a later investigator reported 25,216
feathers on a swan.</p>

<p>But as one thinks of it, more questions arise, as in any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span>
investigation. The answer to one question poses two more.
The first question is, do not the birds in winter need a
wanner plumage to keep out the cold than they do in
summer, when it is warm? Do they have more feathers
then? This was definitely true in the case of the goldfinch:
a bird in summer dress had only 1439 feathers, while one
in winter plumage had 2368 feathers, obviously an adaptation
for cold weather.</p>

<p>The next question is more abstruse, but eminently practical:
the smaller a body, the larger exposed surface for
its weight it presents. That is, for its weight a small bird
has a proportionately much greater surface from which
heat is lost than does a larger one. With equal heat-producing
mechanism and metabolism, a small bird would
need more insulation than a large one. Reduced to its
simplest: one would expect small birds to have relatively
more feathers than large ones: more feathers per gram
of weight. Is this true? Two members of the Department
of Poultry Husbandry at Cornell University, Dr. F. B. Hutt
and Lelah Ball, supplied the answer. Small birds do have
more feathers per gram of body weight than do larger ones.
A hummingbird weighing 2.8 grams had 940 feathers or
335 feathers per gram; a nighthawk weighing 67.9 grams
had 2034 feathers or 29 feathers per gram; while a swan
weighing 6123 grams had 25,216 feathers or 4 feathers
per gram of body weight.</p>

<p>Presumably there are still other relations: Do the birds
that live in the tropics where it is warm have fewer
feathers than species of the same size of arctic climates,
as one would expect? Are certain types of feathers such as
those of aquatic birds better insulated than those of land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">- 68 -</span>
birds, so that the bird requires fewer of them to keep
warm? Does a dense coat of down reduce the number of
feathers needed to keep warm? Do the loose feathers of
ostriches, lacking barbules, necessitate some adjustment
in numbers? The things we've learned point the way to
other questions to be investigated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he wisdom</span> of our fathers is sometimes embodied in
what we call old saws, to wit, "Many hands make light
work," to which the iconoclast retorts, "Too many cooks
spoil the broth." And when we come to the phrase, "As
useless as a last year's bird's nest," we must reply, "Circumstances
alter cases." For many a bird's nest of yesteryear
still has its use; some a biological use to other birds;
some to feed and clothe man.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">SUBLEASES</span> The snug, secure cavity that a woodpecker
chisels in some tree trunk for its nest will last for many
years, a shelter in which tree swallows, house wrens,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
screech owls, bluebirds, or wood mice may make headquarters
and use as a nursery. In the strange forests of
saguaro, a giant cactus of southern Arizona, the nest
cavities of the gila woodpeckers and the gilded flickers in
the cactus trunks seem necessary for the presence of many
nesting birds. Without them the birds would have to go
elsewhere for cavities in which to nest. In old woodpecker
nest cavities the elf owl, pigmy owl, screech owl, sparrow
hawk, ash-throated flycatcher, martin, and crested flycatcher
commonly nest, and cactus wrens and even Lucy's
warbler may use them. Their use is not confined to birds
alone, for scaly lizards, snakes, rats, and mice have been
found in them. In the Argentine there is a woodhewer
that appears to depend on the domed mud nest of the red
oven-bird for its nesting sites. It takes over a recently
vacated or an old nest of the oven-bird and lines it with
grass and feathers for its own use. In Africa and Madagascar
the great domed nest of the hammerkop stork may
find a secondary use in sheltering barn owls.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">SANDPIPERS AND EAGLES</span> But it is not only burrows
and domed nests that when deserted by their original
occupants are used by other birds. The solitary sandpiper
of our northlands belongs to a group in which nest
building is reduced to a minimum, usually little more than
a hollow in the ground with a few bits of material added.
But the solitary sandpiper, and the green sandpiper of
the Old World have broken with tradition and customarily
lay their eggs in the abandoned nest of some thrush. Our
great homed owl is another bird that may use the discarded
nest of a crow or hawk for its eggs and young. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span>
age in the eagle's nest means little to the eagle. Frances
Herrick, the noted chronicler of the life of the American
bald eagle, writes of one nest in the crotch of a lofty tree
that had been in use for thirty-six years. Each year more
material was added until the nest became 12 feet high,
8&frac12; feet across the top, and was estimated to weigh 2 tons.</p>

<p>Man has found, among others, the following two direct
uses for two kinds of birds' nests: one he uses for food;
of another he makes covering for himself.</p>

<p>The swift's nests used for food have been discussed in
another chapter, "Birds' Nests and Their Soup," so here I
will only tell of the use of birds' nests as human covering.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">EIDER-DOWN BLANKETS</span> An eider-down has come
to mean a comforter, a sleeping bag, or even a padded
jacket. But to an ornithologist eider down still has its
older meaning: the down of an eider duck. It is this
material gathered from the eider ducks' nests which forms
the article of commerce. The eider's nest may contain grass,
seaweed, and sticks, but it is notable for the blanket of
down on which the eggs rest, and with which the female
covers the eggs when she leaves them. This down is
plucked from the breast of the female. If it is taken from
the nest she replaces it with more, and it is on this principle
that harvesting of the down is carried out. On islands and
islets in the northern part of the North Atlantic eiders
nest in great numbers in dense colonies. Some of these are
jealously guarded by the local inhabitants, who gather
the first blanket of down from the eggs, and later, after
the eggs have hatched, gather the second crop of down
with which the female has replaced the first to guard her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
eggs against the inclement weather of those boreal latitudes.
Each nest may yield an ounce or so of the precious
down, which is carefully cleaned and sent to market. It is
this material, extremely light, extremely elastic, and one
of the best non-conductors of heat, which finally becomes
the important part of real eider-down comforters, sleeping
bags, and padded jackets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">S</span>ymbiosis</span>, a term from the Greek, is what the biologist
uses for the living together of two dissimilar organisms. In
a broad sense it includes such diverse relations as the lice
living on man and rats in his house, the union of an alga
and a fungus to form a lichen, and the cross-pollination
of flowers by hummingbirds.</p>

<p>The story of the burrowing owls of our Western plains
living in amity with prairie dogs and rattlesnakes as one
happy family comes to mind as an example. But "foolish
nonsense" is how the noted biographer of North American
birds, A. C. Bent, characterizes such stories. He then goes
on to quote evidence as to what actually happens, and one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">- 74 -</span>
can see how the story originated. The prairie dogs, which
are really plump, dumpy, ground squirrels and not dogs at
all, dig their burrows close to each other on the prairie in
colonies which have come to be called prairie-dog towns,
or dog towns or simply "towns." Burrowing owls also take
up their residence in these towns, probably because they
find burrows ready made and do not have to dig their
own as they are quite able to do.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">MODERATELY PREDATORY</span> The owls may make an
occasional meal of a young prairie dog, and a prairie dog
may perhaps dine occasionally on owl eggs, but on the
whole owls and dogs get along on terms of easy familiarity.
Sometimes when alarmed, both may scuttle into the same
burrow for safety, but each has its own burrow. With the
rattlesnake it is different. The rattlesnake may live in burrows
in the dog town, but when it is hungry it eats owl
or dog as occasion offers. While the picture of a happy
family of owl, dog, and snake is a myth, the symbiosis of
owl and dog, at least in the same colony, is striking.</p>

<p>In Africa there is a tiny falcon only about eight inches
long which is called a pygmy falcon because of its small
size. When Dr. Friedmann was studying the social weavers
in South Africa, birds which nest in large colonies under a
common roof they make in a savanna tree, he found these
falcons occupying nest chambers in thriving weaver colonies.
There was no friction between the weaverbirds and
the falcons, and they were sometimes seen to sit side by
side. When Friedmann collected three of these falcons he
found bird remains in their stomachs but they were not
remains of the social weavers. Apparently the falcons were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">- 75 -</span>
feeding largely on small birds, but they did not molest the
weaverbirds which had made the nests the falcons were
using.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">PARROT-DUCK-OPOSSUM M&Eacute;NAGE</span> We occasionally
find a mallard nesting in a tree, on an old crow or hawk
nest, and there are ducks like the wood duck and the
golden-eye, which usually nest in holes in trees, but a
South American duck called the tree teal habitually nests
in a parrot's nest. The parrots, called monk parakeets,
make their nests in compact colonies in the branches of
trees, so close together that they form a single mass. The
tree teal's usual manner of nesting is to lay its eggs in one
of the chambers in this apartment-house colony. At first
the eggs are laid on the rough twig floor of the nest, but as
the eggs increase in number a lining of down, plucked
from the breast of the bird, is added until it may even
extend out the entrance of the nest. Apparently parrot
and duck both get along amicably in their pendant treetop
cradles. An opossum sometimes also finds these parrot
nests to its liking, though one wonders if it may not have
a meal of young parrot or duck in mind. But be that as it
may, in different chambers of a single communal nest of
these parrots, parrots, a duck, and an opossum have been
found.</p>

<p>On islets off the New Zealand coast lives a rather large-sized
lizard called <i>Sphenodon</i>. It's rather well known by
name, at least, for it is one of those relics of a formerly more
widespread group which are called living fossils. It is also
noted for its remarkable development of a pineal eye, the
remnant of an important sense organ in ancestral forms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span>
and formerly an organ some philosophers supposed to be
the seat of the soul. But here we are interested in the fact
that petrels swarm to these same islands to dig their burrows
and lay their eggs in them, and it is in these same
burrows that <i>Sphenodon</i> spends its daylight hours. Apparently
the insect-eating <i>Sphenodon</i> and the oceanic-feeding
petrels share the burrows amicably, adding still
another example of a rather long list of dissimilar organisms
whose lives are associated.</p>

only to remember the great flocks of starlings and blackbirds

Not only in traveling and in feeding, but also at nesting

made of boards, is a man-made thing, but even before the
white man came to this continent, and before the Choctaw
Indians hung up groups of hollow gourds for the martin
colonies to use, the martins nested in colonies. Even in
recent years certain colonies we might consider unprogressive
have been reported as using such diverse nesting
situations as among the boulders of a lake shore in Minnesota,
and the closely spaced woodpecker holes which
riddled a dead pine in Florida. And probably it was always
thus. The martins liked company at nesting.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">CLIFF DWELLERS, TOO</span> Perhaps it would not be
proper to consider a colony of bank swallows, each with a
separate burrow in the same small cut bank and roofed
with the same few square yards of turf of mother earth,
as a real apartment house of cliff dwellers. But the term
has been used in connection with a West Indian woodpecker,
where a dozen pairs were nesting in a single dead
tree, and "the trunk was a veritable apartment house." A
similar situation exists with the naked-faced barbet of West
Africa. This bird too makes a hole in a dead tree for its
nest, like a woodpecker, and colonies of thirty to fifty birds
may be found nesting in a single dead tree, while other
dead trees nearby, apparently equally suitable, are untenanted.
Colonies of hundreds of nests of cliff swallows,
the nests touching and overlapping, may be under the
eaves of a single barn, or as they used to be and some still
are, on the sheltered side of a cliff. But as these birds had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span>
nothing to do with the making of the roof, perhaps these
too do not deserve to be rated as apartment houses.</p>

<p>In southern South America there is a monk parakeet that
makes a real tenement. It nests colonially in treetops, and
the nests of sticks are placed so close together that they
merge and form a single mass, up to nine feet across, in
which each parakeet has its own nest. Similar to this is the
palm chat. This West Indian bird is small and thrush-sized,
dull in color, brownish with a streaked breast, nothing remarkable
to look at, but it carries amazingly large sticks,
little thinner than a lead pencil and as much as two feet
and more long up to the top of a palm tree, and there it
makes its bulky community nest.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BUILD NESTS CO-OPERATIVELY</span> These stick nests,
which may be four feet and more across, are conspicuous
and regular features of the landscape in Hispaniola. The
colony consists of four to eight pairs of birds, and each has
its own apartment in the bulky structure, and its own
passageway to the outside. But in the parts of the community
nests that hold the individual nests together and
cover them there are roughly defined passages running
through the interlacing twigs of the top of the nest so that
the birds can creep about under cover. Apparently some
of the work is carried on in common, for as many as half
a dozen birds may be working close together, pulling and
twisting twigs more firmly into place.</p>

<p>The social weaver is the most advanced apartment
builder. It, like the palm chat, has little of distinction in
its appearance, being mostly dull brownish with a black
face. But in its home country, the savannas of Rhodesia in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span>
southeastern Africa, its huge community nests in the savanna
trees may be seen from afar. The largest Friedmann
saw when he was studying the bird there was about 25
feet by 15 feet, by 5 feet high, and contained about 95
nests. And this might have been still bigger, for part of it
had broken the branch on which it rested and fallen to
the ground. Sir Andrew Smith, the early ornithologist of
South Africa, has written that when these birds start a
colony they first of all make a roof of coarse grass. The
group to which the social weaver belongs gets its name
from the remarkable ability some of them have of weaving
their nesting materials. But the social weaver neither
plaits nor weaves its roof. It puts the roof together in the
form of a well-made hayrick with a fairly definite thatching
arrangement so that the water runs off. This is a community
effort. Under this roof each individual pair makes
its own separate nest. These apartment houses are used
year after year, but last year's chambers are not used, new
ones being made under the roof each year, and so it grows
bigger and bigger until the weight of the mass may break
the branches and cause a part or the whole to fall to the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>n many</span> a well-run American home the children have
definite responsibilities, the older children may help look
after the younger, and even grown-up relatives may stay
as part of the family group. As in so many cases there may
be found parallels to this in the bird world.</p>

<p>The ani, the curious tropical American cuckoo that
makes communal nests, is gregarious and the young of the
first brood become part of the parent flock. Two more
broods may be raised during one season in Cuba, and the
young of the earlier brood may feed their younger brothers
and sisters of the later brood. The same has been recorded
for many other species in the wild: in eastern bluebirds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">- 82 -</span>
mountain bluebirds, wheatears, long-tailed titmice, barn
swallows, coots, rails, and gallinules young have been recorded
as feeding still younger birds. In captivity this
habit has been seen a number of times. Young birds hardly
able to feed themselves may help feed still younger individuals
of the same or other species, and a nestling
crowned hornbill has been seen to offer food to its nestmates.
This tendency to feed nestmates evidently appears
very early in the life of the bird, as Dr. C. O. Whitman,
who worked intensively with pigeons at the University of
Chicago, recorded a hybrid dove only twelve days old that
fed its nestmate.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">FIVE JAYS AT A NEST</span> It was rather generally known
that occasionally more than the two parent birds attended
a nest, but until 1935, when Alexander Skutch, the authority
on the biology of Central American birds, published
his paper "Helpers at the Nest," few of us realized how
widespread this was. Since most birds of a species are
difficult to identify individually, one must actually see the
extra, unmated helpers at the nest along with the parents
to be sure they are there. In the brown jays of Central
America that Skutch studied closely the colors of the soft
parts, bill, feet, and eye rings were variable and he was
able to recognize many individual birds. At five nests he
watched he found at least one helper at each nest, and at
one there were five helpers, all bringing food. Sometimes,
if between an incoming, food-laden bird and the young,
they would take the food and pass it on to the nestling. At
one nest the unmated helper was more zealous in guarding
the nest than were the rightful parents. Sometimes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span>
perhaps, these helpers were unmated young of the parents'
previous year's brood, but this could hardly have been
the case where there were five helpers, for the brown jay
ordinarily raises no more than three young a year. A black-eared
bush tit of Central America seems to have a great
preponderance of males and at one nest in addition to the
parents there were three other males bringing food to the
young.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">MATERNAL PENGUINS</span> Perhaps the most striking example
among birds is the emperor penguin. These birds
breed in the dark and cold of the antarctic winter, on the
edge of the ice shelf. The single egg is carried on the feet
of the brooding bird; indeed one wonders what other
adaptation for holding the egg would be possible in this
land of ice, snow, and water. Only a few of the adults in
each colony lay eggs any year, perhaps one in five, or one
in twelve. But all the adults in the colony have the urge to
incubate and brood. Thus many old birds, rather than
merely the two parents, may take turns caring for each
egg or chick, leaving the rest ample time to feed. So strong
is the urge to brood that struggles may take place over a
chick and it may be very roughly handled. Indeed the
chicks may so resent this that they may creep away into
ice crevices and freeze to death. Another strange turn this
behavior may take is that frozen eggs, dead chicks, and
even bumps of ice of suitable size are carried on the feet
and covered with the birds' feathers by their "would-be
fathers and mothers."</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">A</span> request</span> for the name of a sea bird, a name to be used
for a boat, came to me at my desk in the museum one day.
My memory was quickly exhausted with sea gull, sea
swallow, and albatross. But I keep within reach the handy
guide, <i>Birds of the Ocean</i>, by W. B. Alexander. In the
index I found twenty pages of names, two columns to a
page. They started with <i>aalge, Uria</i>, and went on down
through the alphabet to <i>yelkouan, Puffinus</i>, and to <i>zimmermanni,
Sterna</i>.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">EUPHONY NEEDED</span> A name should be short, pleasant-sounding,
and easy to remember and to say, so obviously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span>
such words as <i>Macronectes</i>, <i>Brachyramphus</i>, <i>Aptenodytes</i>,
and <i>Coprotheres</i> are ruled out among the scientific names.
But further, when choosing a name for a boat from among
those of water birds, one should consider the kind of a
boat. There should be some appropriateness; some points
of resemblance between the boat and the bird, or between
the boat owner and the bird. Albatross seems right for a
seagoing sailing ship, sailing to southern oceans; tern (or
sea swallow) appropriate for light, dainty coastal sailing
craft; puffin or auk or murre for power craft, for these
birds spend most of their time stolidly on the water and
when they fly have a direct buzzing flight. Loon and dabchick
would do well for fresh-water boats. But one objection
to both them and the various auks for a name is that
these birds spend much time swimming underwater. They
might better give their names to submarines. The big,
stocky sea ducks, called scoters and eiders might suit
some stout craft that ply to arctic waters.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">SCIENTIFIC NAMES AVAILABLE</span> I reviewed the
host of other names. Scientific names need not be ignored
either. What is nicer than <i>Gygis</i>, the name of the white,
fairy, or love tern of the South Seas for a small summer
sail boat? Then going farther afield into austral waters for
far traveling craft there's <i>Diomedea</i>, the name of the albatross,
and <i>Daption</i>, the medium-sized petrel that also is
called pintado for the same reason a white-splashed horse
is called a pinto, and <i>Prion</i>, the tiny whalebirds of the
antarctic whose blue-gray back is near the ideal ocean-camouflage
color. <i>Larus</i>, a good honest name without frills,
belonging to the gulls that haunt our harbors, coasts, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">- 86 -</span>
lakes, would do for a plain, everyday sort of boat. Kittiwake
is another gull that spends more time at sea. Gannets
are boldly black and white, strong-flying birds of the North
Atlantic, and one could use that, or its scientific equivalent,
<i>Moris</i>, for a boat.</p>

<p>Penguin and pelican I'm doubtful about; I can't imagine
a boat for either. Skua or jaeger would, of course, be a
lovely symbol for a pirate vessel, as would frigate bird;
both are birds that practice the stand-and-deliver method
of getting food from weaker fisherfolk. The petrels called
shearwaters are among the hardiest seagoing birds, but the
name has little association for most people beyond wondering
if they feed around breakwaters. Petrel itself isn't a
bad name, though one might think of the storm petrels,
which are also called Mother Carey's chickens, and have
been considered the souls of drowned sailors, though their
name perhaps refers to Peter, and his attempt to walk on
the water, as these birds are continually trying to do.</p>

<p>Phalaropes are snipes of sorts that have taken up a
periodic seagoing habit, and their name might often be
appropriate. Even their habit of spinning quickly about as
they sit on the water might still agree. A Chicago man
named his Chris-Craft <i>Sandpiper</i>, after, as he said, the
bird that goes hopping along the beach before the waves.</p>

<p><i>Sula</i> is a good sort of a word, and the name of birds that
are strong, swift fliers of the tropics. But in English they're
usually called booby, which is an English word meaning
simpleton (which name the birds got from stupidly perching
on ships). <i>Alle</i> for the little auk or dovekie would do
for a tiny boat in northern waters, and I knew of one boat
called the <i>Alca</i>, after the razor-billed auk, while <i>Cepphus</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">- 87 -</span>
the name of the black guillemots, is equally good, as is
both <i>Lunda</i> and its equivalent puffin.</p>

<p>Some names have a stark simplicity that would attract
few, like shag, used for the cormorant, and muttonbird for
a petrel. The cahow people might shy from because for
many years we were not sure whether this West Indian
petrel was extinct or not.</p>

<p>Myself, there are two names I rather like and I've been
saving for the last: for a small sailboat I'd say the <i>Wideawake</i>,
as the sooty tern is called in its tropical home, and
the other, for a larger seagoing boat, is the <i>Mollymawk</i>, a
sailor's name for the albatross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">O</span>ne can imagine</span> the consternation in trade-union circles
when it becomes known that there are, among birds, those
who weave and those who sew. Their products are entirely
for home consumption and there are no minimum wage,
no maximum hours, or any fair-trade or quality agreements.
None of the Audubon societies have even touched
on the matter.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">WEAVING</span> The sewing and the weaving is done entirely
in the construction of nests. To take up the weavers first,
we can point to the Baltimore oriole, which makes a sac-shaped,
pendant nest, often hung from the trailing tips of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span>
elm branches. The walls of this sac are formed of fibers
pushed and pulled back and forth with the birds' bills in
a seeming haphazard way so that a roughly woven or
stitched fabric results. But the finest weavers belong to
that group of birds known as weaverbirds. One might expect
that to be an expert weaver a bird would have to
have a slender bill. But no, their bills are short, stout,
clumsy-looking, and sparrowlike. And yet these are the
birds that weave elaborate pendant nests of fibers and
straws. The finest are in shape like an inverted retort, with
the nest proper in an oval chamber, fastened to a branch
by a special strand of fibers, and with a tube or funnel for
an entrance. The walls of these fine weaverbirds' nests are
amazingly strongly and neatly woven. In captivity one of
the weaverbirds, the red-billed weaver, was studied at its
nest building and it was found that the strong, intricate,
and beautiful weaving of this species actually included
knots of several sorts.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">TAILORING</span> The tailoring is done by birds of quite another
group. They are Old World warblers of several sorts,
some in southern Asia and some in Africa. The tailoring
consists of sewing the edges of leaves together to form a
place for their tiny nests. The Indian tailorbird is perhaps
the best known. When these tiny olive-green and gray birds
set about nest building the female punctures the margins
of the leaves with her bill. Then she brings cobwebs and
pushes them through the punctures in the edges of the
leaves, and winds them around, and draws the edges of
the leaves together. Strands of cotton are used too for this.
Sometimes a single leaf is used; its two edges being drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span>
together to form a funnel. Sometimes a number of leaves
are joined. Sometimes it is claimed knots are used, but
this seems not to be the case. What are mistaken for knots
seem made in this way: The cotton used is soft and frays
easily, so that the part of it forced through a tiny aperture
issues as a fluffy knob, which looks like a knot. "The bird
makes no knots; she merely forces a portion of the cotton
strand through a puncture," and the edges of the puncture
catch and hold it, according to Casey Wood, who studied
the birds in India. The lining of the nest is of soft material
and this the bird anchors by making a puncture in the
leaf, grasping a strand of this material, and pulling it out;
the cotton outside then expands into a minute button
which helps hold the nest and contents in place as though
riveted. One nest is recorded as having been so riveted in
seventy-five places.</p>

<p>The camouflage of the tailorbirds' nests is very good;
it is usually built in thick foliage, the leaves are little deranged,
the punctures do not cause the leaf to die; and the
leaves being the same as the others, there is little for the
eye to pick up as indicating a bird's nest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he mother</span> who would leave her infant on a stranger's
doorstep, to be brought up an orphan, not even knowing
its own parents, is a despicable character in human society.
But when we leave the man-made society we must leave
man-made rules of behavior and man-made prejudices behind.
Morals are human. The rest of the animal world is
not immoral, it is amoral. It cannot afford criteria beyond
survival and reproduction. So while we call certain birds
"social parasites," we attach no stigma to them. They represent
several groups: the cowbirds, the weavers, the
cuckoos, the honey-guides, and the ducks.</p>

<p>Carelessness in egg laying is common even in birds that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">- 92 -</span>
ordinarily lay their eggs in their own nest and care for
them themselves, as for instance the robins' eggs that you
may find on your lawn (which of course are wasted; addling
and rotting). Perhaps the fate of the eggs of pheasants
and ruffed grouse which are found in the same nest
may be more happy. Ducks usually make their own nests,
but many species occasionally lay eggs in the nest of another
species, and one South American duck no longer
makes any nest of its own, but is a social parasite, not only
on other kinds of ducks, but also on coots and some other
birds.</p>

<p>The small, well-marked family of honey-guides of Africa,
notable in other ways, also is remarkable for being social
parasites. Their favorite host species, chosen to look after
the eggs and young, are their close relatives, the barbets
(which themselves are most closely related to our woodpeckers).</p>

<p>The nesting of certain African weaverbirds was long a
puzzle to ornithologists until it was found they too were
social parasites, on other weaverbirds.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">VARIED NESTING HABITS</span> The cowbirds, of several
species in North and South America, belong to a family
notable for the variation in its nesting habits. Their nests
vary from the elaborate purse-shaped structures of the
oropendola and orioles to the dome-shaped nest on the
ground of the meadow lark, the simple cup of the bobolink
and redwing; the cowbird makes none. The cowbird lays
its eggs in the nests of a wide variety of other species to be
cared for by them. Here those who discuss the relative
importance of heredity versus environment can profit by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">- 93 -</span>
considering these social parasites. The young cowbird,
hatched and brought up by, say, a yellow warbler, remains
a cowbird. As soon as it no longer needs its foster parents'
care it flocks with other cowbirds, with all their mannerisms
and characteristics, and next season it mates with another
cowbird. There is nothing left of its early environment.</p>

<p>The cuckoos of the New World and some of those of the
Old make their own nests in normal avian fashion. But a
number of Old World species are social parasites, and their
behavior has long been a subject of study and discussion.
Specializations indicate that here perhaps we have the
highest stages of social parasitism. Whereas the cowbird
may grow up with nestmates that are the young of the
foster parent, unless perchance it crowds them out or
starves them if it is larger, the young cuckoo gets the
rightful occupants of the nest on its back and throws them
out of the nest to perish.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">EGGS LOOK ALIKE</span> Another refinement in social parasitism
by the European cuckoo is that apparently certain
individuals, and apparently certain strains, lay their eggs
only in the nests of certain host species. And these cuckoos'
eggs resemble those of the particular species in whose nest
the cuckoos' eggs are laid. For example, if certain cuckoos
lay their eggs only in the nests of meadow pipits these
cuckoos' eggs would resemble those of meadow pipits,
while another group of cuckoos specializing in hedge-sparrows
would have eggs resembling those of hedge-sparrows.
Another oriental cuckoo has a color adaptation
in the young. In southern Asia these cuckoos parasitize
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">- 94 -</span>
crows, and the nestling cuckoos have black feathers like
the young crows; in the Australian area where the same
species of cuckoo occurs it parasitizes grayish-brown honey
eaters and the young are brown, more like the rightful
nestlings. Both these resemblances apparently reduce the
chances of the cuckoos' offspring being rejected by the
foster parents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>t has become</span> commonplace to hear about birds eating
fish. The government gets out reports on the relation of
fish-eating birds to fish abundance. The cries of commercial
fisheries have caused inquiries to be instituted into
the food of cormorants that were supposed to be eating
the fish before they grew up enough for us to eat. The
scarcity of salmon in some of our Northeastern streams
has caused the allocation of biologists to study the predation
of kingfisher and merganser on salmon fry and
fingerlings.</p>

<p>But fish get some of their own back by eating birds. It's
not as spot news as the "man bites dog" angle, but it's
certainly less widely known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">- 96 -</span></p>

<p>To one who has fished for large-mouth black bass
among the cypress trees and the bonnets of water hyacinth,
and seen the bass strike savagely at surface lures as soon
as they hit the surface, it comes as no surprise to find they
strike at, and catch, such birds as Maryland yellow-throats
that flutter across close to the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Young ducks, too, are good game to the large-mouth,
and probably many a young duck finds its way into the
maw of a bass. On a pond where bass had taken many
young ducks I heard a story of a fisherman who made a
floating model of a mother duck, powered it with a propeller,
and attached to it by lines of various lengths several
floating models of downy ducklings. In each duckling was
concealed a hook. The whole flotilla was set afloat, and
drifted across the pond. Mother steamed ahead, with
young following. Soon the bass, used to a duck diet, began
to grab the ducklings. When the model was retrieved
several large bass were taken.</p>

<p>In Northern waters, where Northern pike, or jackfish,
as they're called in the North, abound in duck-nesting
waters, pike are accused of eating enough ducklings to
affect the survival of the broods. Many a marshland traveler
has reported young ducks and young grebes diving,
to be seen no more. He's blamed the pike. Sometimes
perhaps the young bird has simply come up unobserved.
But enough pike's stomachs have proved to have young
ducks in them to demonstrate pike do eat ducklings.
Strangely, in some areas, pike eat many ducklings; in
others they do not eat them. But it's not alone young birds
or small birds that get eaten by fish.</p>

<p>A twenty-four-inch bass is recorded as having been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span>
caught while it still had the legs of a full-grown coot
projecting from its mouth. From beak to tip of its outstretched
legs the coot measured seventeen inches and it
weighed one and one quarter pounds.</p>

<p>Angler fish weighing between forty and fifty pounds
have been found to have eaten birds. One had the band
from a Manx shearwater in its stomach, and another had
an adult American merganser. In tropical and subtropical
seas the examination of birds seemed to indicate they had
been attacked by some fish and seized by the feet, but
were able to escape, and a white-winged black tern off
Corsica has been seen to disappear under the water, presumably
dragged under by a fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he owl</span> has always been considered the symbol of
wisdom. The old saying has it that "fine feathers don't
make fine birds," but I'm afraid that the owl has taken
in people with its appearance. The owl's reputation for
wisdom seems to be based on a staid, impressive appearance
combined with an inarticulate disposition. Though
owls do at times make a great deal of noise, hooting,
shrieking, and whistling, much of the time the owl sits
quietly looking wise and saying nothing. But owls don't
seem to have much behind the front they put up. People
who have studied them find the young are very slow to
learn to feed themselves, and one saw-whet owl that was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">- 99 -</span>
kept captive refused to eat liver put into its cage, apparently
not recognizing the meat as food. But when the liver
was stuffed into an empty mouse skin the owl at once ate
it. One might conclude that the owl was the original
"stuffed shirt."</p>

<p>The crows and their relative, the jays, are the birds
that are really intelligent. They are active and usually
have little trouble getting enough to eat. They have an
abounding curiosity that leads them to spend their time
investigating things and getting new experiences. And
they seem to profit by these experiences, too.</p>

<p>The following is how three ravens co-operated in getting
a bone from a dog, as written by B. J. Bretherton:</p>

<p>"He was espied by a raven who flew down and tried to
scare the dog by loud cawing, in which he was shortly
afterwards assisted by another, both birds sidling up to
the dogs head until they were barely out of his reach.
Just at this time a third raven appeared on the scene and
surveyed the situation from an adjacent fence, but soon
flew down behind the dog and advanced until within reach
of his tail, which he seized so roughly that the dog turned
for an instant to snap at him, and at the same moment
the bone was snatched away by one of the ravens at his
head."</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">CROWS LEARN FROM OTHERS</span> Crows have been recorded
as profiting by the experience of one of their numbers.
In Washington, when almonds were ripening in the
almond orchards and crows were swarming there threatening
to destroy the nut crop, an estimated 30,000 crows
were involved and the destruction of an $800 crop was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">- 100 -</span>
complete in two days. Various methods of control were
tried unsuccessfully. Finally some almonds were slit open,
poisoned, and scattered about in the orchards. Very few
crows were actually poisoned, not exceeding 1 per cent of
the flock. The first reaction of the crows when one of their
number was poisoned was one of extreme panic. There
was tumultuous clamoring and confusion. Then the flock
abandoned the attempts to feed on almonds and left the
area completely. Here we have a case of superior intelligence,
birds profiting by the sight of a few of their numbers
being poisoned fleeing the area and so escaping being
poisoned themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">W</span>e think</span> of wild birds as being shy creatures by nature.
For those of us who have kept a feeding station for birds
in the winter so as to have the pleasure of association with
the chickadee, nuthatches, woodpeckers, and other visitors,
one of the most attractive things is that the wild
birds become tame. Through association with persons they
gradually learn that human beings are not to be feared.
The high point of many a bird lover's experience is when
a chickadee becomes so tame that it will perch on his body
and without fear will feed from his hand.</p>

<p>It seems to be true that birds in wilderness areas are
wilder and more shy of men than those living about dwellings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">- 102 -</span>
where they are protected. This is notably true of
the robin. In villages they hop around on the ground unmindful
of the near presence of humans. How different
they are in the wilderness, where the robins fly away apparently
in great fear, while the human intruder is still
far distant.</p>

<p>It comes as a considerable surprise to find that here and
there over the world there are instances of birds with so
little fear of humans that they come and perch on them.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">PERCHING ON PEOPLE</span> In the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands,
where the general fearlessness of birds is famous, one of
these cases is recorded. David Lack, who was studying the
biology of the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands' birds, found when walking
through the woods on Indefatigable Island that a flycatcher
would sometimes try to settle on his head. Lack
stood still and found the bird's object was to pull out
some of his hair. The bird, having failed to detach any of
the hair of his head, tried, apparently with no better success,
to pull out hair from his eyebrows and then from his
chest. This was at the height of the breeding season and
apparently the bird was trying to get nesting material.
This seemed to be a usual type of behavior there, and
Lack correlated it with the general tameness of the birds
on the islands.</p>

<p>There is a honey eater in Australia that includes in its
pattern of behavior perching on people's heads and shoulders
and attempting to pull out hair for use in its nest.
A. H. Chisholm writes of going to certain places and taking
companions with him for the sake of experiencing this,
and the practice is so common with the species that Australians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">- 103 -</span>
refer to this honey eater as "the hair dresser." In
this case it is not tameness alone. The white-eared honey
eater, which indulges in this practice, is no more tame
most of the time than any of the other small local birds
that live in that part of Australia. Only at nesting time
does it attempt to light on persons. Chisholm correlates
this hair-plucking trait with other habits of the honey eater:
he speaks of its gathering hair from such animals as rock
wallabies and gathering bristles from farmyard pigs and
goats.</p>

<p>Our familiar phoebe has been recorded as perching on
deer hunters in the fall and using them as a vantage point
from which to conduct its hunting. This was in North
Carolina, and the weather being warm, mosquitoes were
notably in evidence. The bird showed no sign of fear or
nervousness, but perched on the hunter's gun, on top of
his head, and various parts of his body, and then flew out
and picked up mosquitoes. As the hunter's face seemed to
be attracting more mosquitoes the phoebe directed his attentions
there. In picking mosquitoes off his face the sharp
points of the bird's bill were noticeably felt at every capture
and the irritation caused by a succession of these
pricks caused the hunter to decide that he could take care
of the mosquito situation better without the help of the
phoebe. As H. H. Brimley, the hunter, put it "... my face
was beginning to feel somewhat inflamed from the frequent
pecks to which it had been subjected so I called it
a day and told the phoebe to stop pestering me." This
took place in a wild part of North Carolina and Brimley
suggested that the phoebe's abnormal lack of fear was
caused by its having never seen a human being before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">P</span>ilfering</span>, or petty theft, is one of the less desirable but
very human attributes of our race. But it's also pretty
widespread in the animal kingdom. Theft as the usual
thing is practiced by only a few birds. But when it's a case
of petty theft, happening now and then, it is common
enough in the bird world. It's not restricted to any group
of birds, but may crop up almost anywhere. There's no
threat or fight about it usually. The bird, which gets its
food by means of the acuity of its vision and the quick
co-ordination of its movements with the recognition of its
food, sees the food in another bird's possession and just
goes up and takes it. Sometimes the food is taken from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">- 105 -</span>
larger and stronger bird, an achievement accomplished by
audacity, agility, and quickness. A sparrow hawk, that inoffensive
little rufous-red falcon that spends most of its
time catching grasshoppers, was sitting on a telephone
wire holding a small mammal it had caught, apparently
about to devour it, when a loggerhead shrike sitting nearby
flew straight to the hawk, seized its prey, and made off,
leaving the hawk sitting there, apparently dumfounded by
the audacity and success of the attack. A case in which the
pilfering caused a mild fuss involved an English kingfisher
and a dipper. The kingfisher lit above a pool where a dipper
was feeding, obtaining food in the pool and bringing
it ashore to eat it. When the dipper next came ashore the
kingfisher flew down, there was a momentary scuffle, and
the dipper departed, leaving its food to the kingfisher, who
promptly ate it. Despite this occurrence the dipper allowed
itself to lose its prey again before it left, and the kingfisher
presumably had to resume fishing for itself.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">THEFT NOT RESENTED</span> It is sometimes surprising
that this pilfering, when it occurs over and over again, is
not actively resented, particularly when the pilferer is a
smaller bird. Some of the thrushes are especially docile
when they're victimized. Sometimes when American robins
are feeding on the ground, house sparrows hop along with
them, and when the robin finds a worm the sparrow hops
up quietly and boldly takes the worm from the robin with
scarcely a protest from the victim. One robin is reported to
have been robbed six times, of six worms, one right after
the other by a small flock of sparrows while the robin continued
to hunt for worms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">- 106 -</span></p>

<p>The starling, an aggressive Old World species introduced
and very successful here, also victimizes the American
robin. In one case a starling made four successful raids in
five minutes, the robin not attempting to fight or defend its
food, but simply moving off a little way and continuing to
hunt for worms while the starling waited nearby.</p>

<p>This is not a new trait of the starling, for in its Old
World home, in Britain, it has been seen to victimize
blackbirds and song thrushes (relatives of our robin).
This happened when a blackbird pulled up a worm, a
starling flew to the spot, and the blackbird moved away,
leaving the worm to the starling. This method of obtaining
worms was sometimes used by all the starlings on a lawn
where both species were feeding, much to the hindrance
in the feeding of both blackbirds and song thrushes.</p>

<p>Gulls have been recorded as snatching fish from mergansers
that had caught fish by underwater dives and
brought them to the surface to eat. Gulls also follow pelicans,
and just after the pelican has completed its plunge
and before it can swallow the fish protruding from its bill,
a gull may flutter in, alight on the water or even on the
pelican's head, and seize the fish. The pelican does not
attempt to do anything about it, but accepts the pilfering
with stoic calm.</p>

<p>Grackles victimizing ibises seems perhaps the strangest
of the whole series of reports. The ibis often attempts to
elude the grackles but without success. About Lake Okeechobee,
Florida, where ibis are common, they feed largely
on crayfish, which they secure by probing the holes made
by these creatures. Grackles swarm there, and, on occasion,
no sooner does an ibis seize a crayfish than one to four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">- 107 -</span>
grackles try to secure it. The ibis may take flight and attempt
to escape with its prey, but one of the grackles
usually gets the crayfish away from it.</p>

<p>Possibly some of these birds are on their way to becoming
habitual pilferers, in which such social parasitism is a
fixed mode of life. With evolution, if this thieving benefits
the species that snatch the food, it may become a usual
habit. For habits, like structures, are subject to variations,
to selection, and thus to change and elaboration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">N</span>ot until</span> 1948 did the scientific world have satisfactory
evidence that any bird hibernated. True, it was an established
fact that sometimes in cold weather some birds,
notably swifts and hummingbirds, might become torpid
for a short time, but this was not hibernation.</p>

<p>The early literature, of more than a century ago, contained
many accounts, some claiming to be firsthand, of
birds hibernating. Swallows in particular were reported as
seen to submerge in ponds in the autumn. Numbers of
them were said to have been found hanging to submerged
willow branches apparently sleeping the winter away.
When ponds were drained in winter, sometimes swallows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">- 109 -</span>
were said to have been found buried in the mud, revived,
and upon occasion kept alive indoors until the spring.
Sometimes slime-covered swallows, evidently just out of
hibernation, were reported found in the spring. Swallows
were the most commonly recorded, but other species, too,
were mentioned as hibernating, such as the cuckoo that
shed its feathers and crept into a crevice to sleep away
the winter.</p>

<p>Such accounts gradually disappeared from the literature.
We can accept none of them. The old records of underwater
and also the featherless hibernation of birds must
be discarded. The occasional torpidity, in cold weather, of
swallows, swifts, and hummingbirds is another matter, and
appears to be of sporadic though not common occurrence.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">FROGS MISTAKEN FOR BIRDS</span> It is interesting to
speculate as to how the old "firsthand" accounts originated.
They had certain basis of fact. The first was that swallows
were seen flying about in summer. They disappeared in
winter. Aristotle claimed they hibernated, in a featherless
condition, so there was nothing unusual in seeing them
that way. Observation was less critical, and it is probable
that frogs from the mud of ponds were mistaken for naked
swallows, and perhaps bats, which do hibernate, taken
from caves or hollow trees, were also mistaken for swallows.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">AN AUTHENTIC RECORD</span> In 1948, and again in 1949,
Edmund C. Jaeger, of California, published accounts of a
poor-will he found hibernating. This was the first acceptable
evidence that such a thing occurs. In a little cavity in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span>
the wall of a canyon in the Chuckawalla Mountains of the
Colorado desert in California, Jaeger found a poor-will in
a state of profound torpidity in December, 1946. He could
pick out the bird in his hand, examine it and put it back
in the little cavity it occupied without eliciting more than
a slight movement of its eyelids. On a later occasion handling
it revived it somewhat.</p>

<p>The next winter Jaeger found a poor-will, perhaps the
same bird, hibernating in the same niche. Over a period of
eighty days, from November 26, 1947, to February 14,
1948, he visited it periodically, examined it, and took its
temperature. The body temperature was low, 64&deg;-68&deg; F.,
compared with more than 100&deg; F. of an active bird; with
a medical stethoscope he could detect no heartbeat, and
a cold metal mirror held directly in front of its nostrils
collected no moisture from its breathing. The body processes
were evidently very low. The bird was banded for
identification, and in the third winter the same bird wearing
the same band was found to have returned to hibernate
again in the same rock niche. But on subsequent visits it
was missing&mdash;perhaps having lived out its allotted span,
perhaps the prey of some predator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>here are</span> occasionally discovered behavior patterns of
birds that are so unusual as to make one stop and wonder.
They are unusual for birds generally, but in a species here
and there they are the regular thing. Such is the placing of
a shed snakeskin in their nests by some birds.</p>

<p>A bird like the English sparrow, or the road runner,
which uses a variety of material coarse or fine, would be
expected to use shed snakeskins occasionally, as it came
across them. But there are a number of species that seem
to use snakeskins regularly in their nests. It would seem
that the birds deliberately sought out the skins for this
purpose, as though they were as much a part of the nest as
the mud in the bottom of a robin's nest or the fresh green
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">- 112 -</span>
grass heads ornamenting the entrance to some weaverbirds'
nests.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">SOME HABITS BAFFLING</span> I have long since given up
thinking that every aspect of a bird's life must serve a
useful purpose. Indeed I have already pointed out some
definite maladaptations. But usually every type of behavior
has a logical origin. By considering its occurrence in various
species and against the background of the bird's
everyday life some correlations usually can be found.</p>

<p>The list of birds habitually using snakeskins in their
nests is short, as follows:</p>

<p>1. Great-crested flycatcher&mdash;belonging to the New
World flycatchers, breeding in Eastern North America and
nesting in holes.</p>

<p>2. Arizona crested flycatcher&mdash;a relative of the great-crested
variety, with similar habits.</p>

<p>3. Blue grosbeak&mdash;an American member of the sparrow
family, making an open nest in bushes.</p>

<p>4. Black-crested titmouse&mdash;a member of the chickadee
family, living in Western North America and nesting in
holes.</p>

<p>5. Bank mynah&mdash;a starling, living in southern Asia and
nesting in holes in banks.</p>

<p>6. Rifle bird&mdash;an Australian bird of paradise, making a
cup-shaped nest in trees.</p>

<p>7. Madagascar bulbul&mdash;making a cup-shaped nest in
trees.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">LIKE A DECORATION</span> Twenty or more other species
of birds have been recorded as using snakeskins more or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">- 113 -</span>
less commonly, or occasionally perhaps on the basis of
availability or of chance. But with the above they're an
essential part of the nest. In some of the species the snakeskins
are arranged as a rim around the edge of the nest
almost as a decoration; sometimes the snakeskins may
make up most of the nest.</p>

<p>Now as to possible correlations. The species are not
closely related. Except for the two flycatchers the other
five represent five different families. The distribution over
the world is wide, too: America, Asia, Madagascar, Australia.
Various explanations for the behavior have been
advanced. It has been suggested that it's correlated with
hole nesting, but three of the seven do not nest in holes.
The most common theory is that it's to frighten away
possible predators by making them think there is a snake
in the nest. However, this is not very likely, and, too, one
wonders why the birds that use the snakeskins are not
frightened themselves. Indeed, one writer, surely not seriously,
has suggested that the fright in early life of crested
flycatchers at finding a snakeskin in the nest accounts for
the upstanding crest in this species!</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">"BURGLAR ALARM" THEORY</span> Another suggestion is
that the snakeskin, by the rustling noise it makes when
touched, acts as an alarm bell or a burglar alarm to warn
the rightful occupants of the nest when an intruder approaches.
This also seems a rather weak explanation.</p>

<p>We are left, then, with the fact that this curious habit
has been developed in a few birds, not closely related, that
live in various parts of the world and that have very different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">- 114 -</span>
habits. It is usual with them. A number of others
occasionally have this habit.</p>

<p>My first clue as to the proper background against which
to solve this habit came when, unpacking a bird collection
made in Borneo by curator of anatomy D. Dwight Davis,
I took out a bulbul's nest. In its outer edge were flat,
weathered leaves that resembled snakeskins. Later, when
we received a bird collection from Dr. D. S. Rabor of the
Philippines there was a nest of another species of bulbul
and this too had flat, dead, weathered leaves in it that
looked like snakeskin. When I was in Madagascar, in 1929-31,
I had found three nests of the Madagascar bulbul with
a snakeskin used in each. Here was a clue. I decided to
investigate the nests of the other species of bulbuls of
southern Asia and Africa where the family is represented
by many species. By considering the snakeskin-using
species against the background of the nesting of the other
species some correlation might appear.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BOOKWORK</span> This became a library problem at once. I
had to look up the earlier reviews of the problem in the
ornithological journals, <i>The Auk</i> and the <i>Ornithologische
Monatsberichte</i>, then in Strong's <i>Bibliography of Birds</i>, to
make sure that no important papers were missing from my
own subject file. Stuart Baker's <i>Fauna of British India,
Birds</i> had a large part of one volume devoted to bulbuls,
and gave excellent summaries of the nidification of each
species occurring there. Bannerman's <i>Birds of Tropical
West Africa</i> covered the western part of that continent,
and Jackson's and Sclater's <i>Birds of Kenya Colony</i> did the
same for the eastern part. For collateral material I looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">- 115 -</span>
in Mathews' <i>Birds of Australia</i>, Volume 12, Forbush's
<i>Birds of Massachusetts</i>, and Mrs. F. M. Bailey's <i>Birds of
New Mexico</i>, and a dozen minor publications.</p>

<p>But it was worth it.</p>

<p>Perhaps my earlier thinking was dominated by the
thought that the shed snakeskins had been parts of animals
toward which many birds show an antipathy. But it's extremely
probable a bird does not recognize the snakeskin
as such. Rather to it the shed snakeskin is a strip of thin,
flexible material. Obviously it would be used, by chance,
by many bird species, such as the house wren, which, in
addition to using such natural materials as twigs, grass,
and hair, has been recorded as using lead pencils, paper,
nails, safety pins, and snakeskins in its nest.</p>

<p>As to the regular users of snakeskin, the snakeskin-using
Madagascar bulbul did fit into a pattern. Bulbuls in general
make characteristic simple cup nests. Some species
use almost any available material. But quite a few species
had specific choices of materials: one species' nest had
tendrils of vines in its base; another a lining of grass heads
of a certain color; another pine needles; another red dead
leaves; and the Madagascar bulbul snakeskins.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">A SOLUTION</span> There seems to be a tendency for many
species to make distinctive nests. They often accomplish
this by a choice of material used by few or no other
species. What more natural than that one species, being in
a country where snakes are common, should hit on shed
snakeskins!</p>

<p>To show that the choice of snakeskin as nesting material
is an expression of a tendency for each species of bird to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span>
make a different kind of nest may not be much of an answer.
But it is to an extent. No longer do we say, "Why
are certain birds' nests characterized by snakeskins?"
Rather we have the broader, more general question, "Why
does each kind of bird tend to build a nest different from
that of every other kind?" Thus, little by little, we clear
away small, vexing questions and resolve them into larger,
more general questions. For answers to these we sometimes
plan extended work involving field studies, studies
of specimens, and books. And sometimes, as we examine a
specimen, read a paper, or unpack a shipment, an answer,
or at least a clue, springs to our mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he importance</span> of co-operation, contrasted with competition,

Co-operation in nature is of various kinds; from the
manner in which a forest shelters the squirrel to the
manner in which two or more individuals of one species
work together for a common object. The working together
of two birds to rear a family is so well known an affair that
one forgets that it is an example of co-operation, not only
in building the nest and brooding and feeding the young,
but also in defending the nest and the young.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">- 118 -</span>
enemy. For example, when a cat caught a young robin, recently
out of the nest, the parents, in their frantic effort to
make the cat release the bird, attracted the attention of
another robin and a pair of cardinals nesting nearby in a
honeysuckle. All five birds dived at the cat, screaming and
pecking it so vigorously that it released the young robin
and fled.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">EAGLES JOIN EFFORTS</span> More spectacular are some
of the co-operative activities of birds in food getting. Bald
eagles sometimes feed on ducks. Frequently two eagles
may combine their efforts. The two birds may work together
to force a black duck from the air onto the water,
and when they are trying to catch a diving duck, they
much more quickly exhaust their prey by swooping at it in
turn. Bald eagles sometimes take water birds too large for
them to carry, and then they must flap along dragging
their prey on the surface of the water to the nearest shore.
On one occasion an eagle dragging a large cormorant
ashore was joined by two other birds, and all three took
turns in dragging it. When they got it ashore, all three
shared it.</p>

<p>Several fish-eating birds co-operate in capturing their
prey. "The merganser is primarily a fishing duck ...
very skillful and a voracious feeder. It pursues underwater
and catches successfully the swiftest fish. Often a party of
sheldrakes may be seen fishing together, driving the panic-stricken
fish into the shallows or into some small pool
where they may be more easily caught," according to
A. C. Bent.</p>

<p>When a school of fish approached a flock of white pelicans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">- 119 -</span>
the birds suddenly assumed a circular position, surrounding
the school. All the pelicans moved slowly but
cautiously toward the center of the circle, their heads near
the surface of the water or partly submerged and their
necks slightly extended. The birds moved in perfect
unison, making the circle progressively smaller, ready to
engulf their helpless victims at the first opportunity. When
all the pelicans were close to the fish, the birds made rapid
jabs at the fish and apparently consumed a large number
of them. It appeared that every bird got from one to several
fish.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">13,000 BAND TOGETHER</span> Avocets and, to a lesser
extent, the black-necked stilts also band together for co-operative
drives on small fry and aquatic insects. Such
drives are made in water of wading depth. Instead of
forming circles the birds present compact spearhead and
wedge formations and sweep the bottom muck with the
characteristic back-and-forth side movements of their long
bills. As many as 13,000 avocets have been observed taking
part in such co-operative feeding projects.</p>

<p>Another striking example is furnished by black vultures
observed by E. A. McIlhenny. A three-quarters-grown
skunk was wandering across a field. A vulture alighted
near the skunk which immediately stopped and raised its
tail. Other nearby vultures joined the one nearby the
skunk, and when six or eight of them had gathered one
suddenly attacked it. The skunk immediately discharged
its defensive scent, but without effect, for the vultures attacked
in a mass and other vultures circling above joined
in until there were probably twenty-five or more around
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">- 120 -</span>
the skunk. With much flapping and croaking, the vultures
pulled it about until it was dead, and then devoured it.</p>

<p>On another occasion a black vulture came from high in
the air to alight near two full-grown opossums following
a narrow cattle trail. The first vulture was almost at once
joined by many others until there were probably between
seventy-five and one hundred black vultures following the
opossums. Suddenly three or four of the vultures attacked
and the others joined in. Quickly both opossums were covered
with a swarm of hissing, flapping birds, and within
fifteen minutes there was nothing left of them but the
larger bones and the hides, and these were stripped of
every vestige of flesh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">A</span> savage watchdog</span> outside his master's house helps to
protect it. If an intruder comes, the watchdog, if it's the
right kind, simply bites him without preliminaries. There's
a parallel to this in the bird world. Some birds often have
their nests close to wasps' or bees' nests, or in trees inhabited
by biting ants. The birds and the ants, wasps, or
bees get along without disturbing each other. But when
intruders come along the insects swarm out, biting or
stinging and driving the intruder away. The insects are
protecting their own homes, but one of the results, the
protecting of the birds' homes, is just as satisfactory to the
birds as if they did it on purpose. This building of birds'
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">- 122 -</span>
nests close to wasps' nests is a common practice with certain
sunbirds and weaverbirds, especially in Africa. It occurs
too often to be chance. The question naturally arises
as to how much the birds understand of it all&mdash;do they
actually seek out the association? That's difficult to say,
but the facts of the association are still there.</p>

<p>Though some of these associations are evidently fairly
common and chosen deliberately by the birds&mdash;and one
can easily visualize how the protection works&mdash;field observations
as to the natural enemies against which they
are effective, and how effective they are, are largely lacking.
Usually the records are something like those of Van
Rossem for the Giraud's flycatcher in El Salvador, in
which he points out that this bird usually nests in certain
mimosa trees armed with numerous heavy, curved thorns.
These thorns are hollowed out and inhabited by swarms
of small but extremely hostile antlike insects, so that the
nest is well protected. However, the effectiveness of ant
and bee protection against human predation can be seen in
the following.</p>

<p>Take the case of Mr. M. E. W. North, who arranged a
rope to climb to a fish eagle's nest in East Africa. He had
gotten about fifty feet up and was considering going out
on the big limb on which the nest was, when he noticed a
wild bee on his sleeve. Realizing that he was disturbing a
wild-bee hive, and knowing that the sting of these vicious
bees can be dangerous, fatalities having been reported, he
came down his rope at express speed, crashing through
projecting branches and brambles. Reaching the ground,
he freed himself from the rope and fled to a safe distance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">- 123 -</span>
considering himself lucky to have received only three
stings.</p>

<p>On another occasion, again in East Africa, Mrs. R. E.
Moreau attempted to reach a hawk's nest to measure the
eggs, but when she was up in the tree, savage, biting red
ants drove her out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>n Africa</span> there are birds which lead men to honey. They
are called honey-guides and their family name, Indicatoridae,
has the same idea incorporated into it. Though
there are several species of these small, dull-colored birds,
which are related on the one hand to woodpeckers and
on the other to barbets, it is only one species, the common
or black-throated honey-guide that is well known as a
guide to honey.</p>

<p>The traveler in the country may find one of these birds
chattering and flying ahead of him. The natives, who know
this bird well and favorably will tell the traveler to follow;
it will lead to a bee tree. The native, as he follows this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">- 125 -</span>
guide, gives occasional whistles, as if to encourage the
bird. The bird continues, flying from perch to perch,
ahead, and chattering noisily. Sometimes it may return to
see if the men are following; sometimes it remains chattering
on its perch until the followers catch up. Finally the
bird will go no farther. It flies about aimlessly and allows
one to approach closely. This is the spot. In a hole in the
tree trunk, or in the ground nearby the bees' nest is to be
found.</p>

<p>When the beehive is opened, and the honey taken, the
honey-guide will eat the comb that is left, and apparently
it is for this that the complicated behavior of leading of
man to the beehive is developed.</p>

<p>Wax of the honeycomb is a usual food of this species,
judging by stomach examinations, and one wonders how
they get it when man is not about to open the bee trees
for them. The birds have no special adaptation for getting
into the hives; indeed their only apparent adaptation for
this habit is a thick skin, perhaps a protection against bee
stings. Perhaps, as has been suggested, other animals,
squirrels, monkeys, or honey badgers may unwittingly
aid them by opening up bee trees for their own purposes
and allow the honey-guides to snatch food for themselves.</p>

<p>An amusing side of the picture is that sometimes the
honey-guides may lead the honey hunter to a beehive
owned by a native.</p>

<p>There are also records of the honey-guide leading men
to big game: leopard or lions. That this occurs is amply
documented, but one wonders whether or not this was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">- 126 -</span>
accidental; the honey-guide leading the way to honey perhaps
by accident leads the way past the resting place of
one of these big cats so that the man stumbles over the
big game and perhaps gets the impression he was led to
the animal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he lives</span> of oxpeckers are so linked to those of large,
hoofed game or domestic cattle that in West Africa where
game is scarce the birds depend on cattle, and their range
is restricted accordingly. There the cattle are confined
to the higher and more northern areas, free of tsetse flies,
from Senegal to Northern Cameroon. Thus tsetse flies help
to determine the limits of the oxpeckers' range.</p>

<p>Except for their nesting, which is in holes in trees, and
their sleeping, most of their time is spent on the bodies of
the larger herbivores. There they run about over the hides
and legs of the beasts, like woodpeckers on a tree. They
stay remarkably close to the animals, and even ride on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">- 128 -</span>
them as they travel. The oxpeckers' food is largely ticks,
which it gets from the hide of the animal by working over
it with the side of its bill, shearing off the ticks with a
scissorlike action of its mandibles. But when an animal has
sores or cuts or scratches the oxpecker may peck into them,
and eat flesh and blood of its host.</p>

<p>Correlated with this unusual and close relationship, a
modification in the oxpeckers has taken place. There are
only two species, both African, and they are dull-colored,
modified starlings. The legs are stout, with curved, very
sharp claws for clinging to the hides of animals, and the
bill, very sharp at the tip, with the cutting edge of the
mandible very sharp to aid in scissoring off ticks.</p>

<p>All the larger herbivores are attended by oxpeckers except
the elephant and the hippo, but the favorite seems to
be the rhino, and for this he's sometimes called the rhino
bird as well as tickbird and oxpecker. The rhino gives the
bird its food, and in return the bird provides a service of
a value difficult to evaluate. It acts as a sentinel and may
warn the rhino of the approach of hunters, for which habit
it is execrated by sportsmen.</p>

<p>It would seem that such relationships could have developed
only where the supply of big game was large.
With the introduction of cattle and other domestic animals
it was natural the oxpecker should turn its attention to
them. Here the question arose as to the attentions of the
oxpeckers being harmful or otherwise to the herds. Mr.
R. E. Moreau, formerly of the East African Research Station
at Amani, has investigated the problem. He finds that
white men who own herds tend to consider the oxpecker
a nuisance; Africans tend to consider it beneficial and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">- 129 -</span>
some African cattle owners object to having the birds
killed; the beasts themselves tolerate the birds.</p>

<p>There is the possibility on the one hand of oxpeckers
spreading certain cattle diseases that are mechanically
transmitted, and on the other hand they may help reduce
disease by eating ticks, the vectors of certain diseases. Of
course dipping the cattle takes care of ticks on them, and
here we see another indirect effect of civilization on bird
life. When cattle have been dipped the oxpeckers disappear
from the herd. Perhaps it is because there is no longer
food for them there; perhaps they get enough of the
poison dip left on the beasts' hair to be lethal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he obvious adaptation</span> of a bird's wings is for locomotion;
to fly in the air. It is true that some few birds are
flightless, and some like the penguins use their wings for
underwater swimming, but this does not spoil the generalization.</p>

<p>Secondary uses, some with special adaptations, occur:
the owl at bay spreads its wings wide, with the effect of
increasing its apparent size and being more terrifying to a
predator. The young bird, begging to be fed, flutters its
wings in a characteristic way, and the female, in some of
her mating behavior, may also flutter her wings like those
of a young bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">- 131 -</span></p>

<p>In courtship the wings may play an important part in
display. In the Australian rifle bird they are held out, fully
spread on each side of the bird like a velvet curtain against
which the vivid iridescence of the throat patch stands out
more vividly. The argus pheasant has the inner secondaries
greatly elongated and ornamented in a fashion recalling
the decoration of a peacock's tail and these he spreads to
show in his courtship, while the ruffed grouse uses his
wings to make instrumental music, his drumming.</p>

<p>Wings in geese and swans may be used in fighting, and
tame birds may severely buffet humans who take too close
an interest in their young. In the related screamers of
South America the bend of the wing is equipped with
long, very sharp spurs, which undoubtedly make formidable
weapons in fighting.</p>

<p>In addition wings are used in at least three different
ways in feeding. The red-tailed hawk may spread its wings
as it sits on its prey, perhaps a behavior adapted to help
the bird maintain its balance when dealing with struggling
prey, perhaps to help smother the struggles of its
prey.</p>

<p>The secretary bird of Africa is said to feed on snakes,
poisonous and non-poisonous ones, and is said to use its
huge wings as shields for its body in attacking them.</p>

<p>But the strangest use of wings in feeding is that practiced
by a blackish African heron. In feeding in shallow
water it takes a few rapid steps, apparently to bring it
within reach of fish it has sighted, then spreads its wings,
bringing them forward until they meet, and with the tips
of the quills in the water. The head is in the canopy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">- 132 -</span>
formed by the wings, and apparently it is here under this
canopy that the fish on which it feeds are caught. The suggestion
as to the correlation that presents itself is that the
dark canopy thrown over the fish confuses them and makes
them easier to catch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">V</span>ocal music</span> bulks large in our avian springtime chorus,
but don't overlook the instrumental music that accompanies
it. The drumming of the downy woodpecker on the
dead limb of a maple near my bedroom window is as much
a part of my spring as is the cheery cheerup of our robin.
It's not that woodpeckers are voiceless that they drum.
The flicker can be called in with his particularly rich
repertoire to repudiate it vociferously. All day the downy
woodpecker goes about pounding his head against tree
trunks, with his bill chiseling out wood-boring insects to
eat. What more natural when springtime comes and he
wants to tell the world, and especially other woodpeckers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">- 134 -</span>
about it, to select a dead limb with a nice tone in my
maple tree and hammer out a rolling tattoo&mdash;his love song
and his challenge.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">A DRUMMER</span> The gray-brown ruffed grouse of a wood
lot we used to have in the Chicago area is a drummer I
miss. "Thump-thump ..." he started slowly, and then
quickened to a roll that filled the forest with hollow sound
and you wondered whence it came, unless you happened
to know, as I did, that an old log in the patch of gray birch
was the old cock's favorite performing stand. There he
came to roll out his invitation to the demure hen grouse.
A drummer, I've called him, yet he has no drum. It's his
wings, striking the air, that thump and build up into a roll,
its volume testifying to his great breast muscles as well as
does the whir of wings as he hurtles away through the air
when I come too close.</p>

<p>The snipe of a nearby marsh makes music with feathers
and wind, music that is more enthralling to me than the
song of the yellowthroat or the vocal imitation of stake
driving by the bittern. Circling high, then with a change
of pace, his "winnowing" or "bleating" spring song comes
drifting down. There is still room for argument, but probably
it's air rushing past the outer tail feathers that makes
the sound. One year a short-eared owl nested in the nearby
meadow. Owls generally are vocalists, even if we don't
rate very high their hoots or yelps, but the short-eared owl
also has an instrumental performance. Sometimes, when
giving his mating song on the wing, a series of "toots," he
interrupted this by a dive in which he brought his wings
together under his body, with a clapping sound. It's part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">- 135 -</span>
of the performance, but not, as might be said, the owl applauding
his own show.</p>

<p>Over our public school each evening in early summer a
nighthawk booms. He has a voice, and he uses it, calling
"beep" as he circles high. But the climax of his performance
is instrumental, wind on feathers. He heads down,
wings high, toward the flat gravel roof on which his mate
is sitting. As he approaches the roof he moves his wings
down; the air rushing past the quills gives a tearing boom
as he comes out of the dive and mounts skyward again.</p>

<p>At dusk, at a damp corner of our old wood lot, in the
spring, I listened for the woodcock's flight song, a twittering
of wing music as he circles up, and sweet music, too,
for a wild fowler's ears, is the whistling of the wings of a
passing pair of black ducks on their way in the early darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he classical experiment</span> in conditioning and reflexes
is that of Pavlov. It consisted of sounding a bell each time
food was given to a dog. Finally the salivary response resulted
even when the bell was rung, without the food
being given to the dog. The dog was <i>conditioned</i> to the
bell. First it had responded to the food, then to the food
and the bell, and finally to the bell alone, by a flow of
saliva. The beauty of this experiment is in its simplicity,
dealing as it does with a single reflex.</p>

<p>Though much behavior is more complex, experiments
have been worked out to show how the environment, in a
broad sense, can influence inherited behavior. An illuminating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">- 137 -</span>
example of this is the one I made dealing with
young loggerhead shrikes and the duration of their infantile
behavior. Young shrikes, as with young passerine
birds in general, while in the nest are fed directly by the
parents, who place food in their mouths. One of the earliest
behavior patterns these young birds perform is to
stretch up with widely opened mouth, fluttering wings,
and buzzing calls, in anticipation of being fed. This we
call begging. Though typically infantile behavior, it may
reappear in courtship, but this latter we will not consider
here.</p>

<p>Ordinarily this infantile begging behavior is discontinued
shortly after the young birds leave the nest and
become able to feed themselves. Observations indicate
that in a state of nature this change is probably hastened
in part by the young birds themselves, who come to avoid
having food thrust down their gullets, and prefer to pick
up the food for themselves, and in part by the waning
interest of the parents in the young, which confers an advantage
on the young who early become self-supporting.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">CASE OF RETARDED DEVELOPMENT</span> Certain observations
made from time to time have indicated that
though the age at which young birds changed from infantile
begging for food to self-supporting independence
was a fixed thing, started by instinct, certain external
factors, notably the amount of care the young received,
could affect the age at which this change occurred. Indeed
there was a record of a young cedar waxwing raised by
hand who never learned to feed itself.</p>

<p>When I secured a brood of four young loggerhead
shrikes, or butcherbirds, the material was available to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">- 138 -</span>
conduct a controlled experiment. The young birds were raised
together by hand to the stage where they were ready to
begin to pick up things, to feed themselves, and to begin
to abandon their infantile behavior of begging for food.
This was when they were twenty-one days old. They were
then divided into two lots and housed separately. One
couple had a supply of food kept in front of them, and
hand feeding was gradually discontinued and stopped as
soon as possible. At the age of twenty-eight days they fed
themselves well, though they still begged freely when I
approached. By the time they were thirty-nine days old
they begged rarely, and after the age of forty-five days
they were not seen to beg.</p>

<p>The other couple had no free food available at any time,
and they were fed completely by hand, the food being
placed in their mouths. At the age of twenty-eight days
they had made no effort to feed themselves. By the time
they were fifty-three days old they made efforts to feed
themselves, trying to peck the food from the fingers instead
of having it thrust into their mouths, and evidently
would have changed quickly to independent self-feeding
and abandoned their infantile begging behavior. But hand
feeding was continued. At the age of seven and a half
months, when the experiment was discontinued, though
these birds were capable of feeding themselves, as was
seen when food was accidentally dropped on the floor of
their cage, they still begged for food from their human
foster parent.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">OBJECT LESSON FOR PARENTS</span> These four birds
used in this experiment were nestmates, and had similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">- 139 -</span>
heredity and early environment. The birds in the lot which
received only enough care to ensure proper development
became self-feeding, independent, and lost their infantile
begging behavior when they were about a month and a
half old. The other lot, which received an excessive amount
of care in the latter part of infancy, and were hand fed
without being allowed to develop the behavior that would
have made them independent, retained the infantile behavior
pattern of begging to be fed until the end of the
experiment. They were then seven and a half months old,
and their nestmates, under a different set of conditions,
had lost their infantile behavior six months earlier.</p>

<p>With some birds it appears excessive care can be a conditioning
factor. It can delay the loss of infantile behavior
and the acquiring of the normal independence. Though
instinctively the young shrikes tried to develop their independent
behavior, when this was not possible they continued
their dependent, conditioned behavior.</p>

This has received most attention in the insect world,
the bad-tasting grasshoppers being examples. Toads have
an acrid secretion from their skins which deters many
would-be toad eaters, and pickerel frogs have somewhat
the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">- 141 -</span></p>

<p>The following three birds, which are recorded as having
poisonous flesh, are, strangely enough, all members of
groups ordinarily considered good table birds. Further, it
seems the poisonous properties of their flesh are not constant,
but apparently depend on what they have been
eating.</p>

<p>The ruffed grouse of the United States is regarded by
many as the finest of upland game birds and favored by
the epicure. However, Mr. E. H. Forbush, in his monumental
<i>Birds of Massachusetts and Other New England
States</i>, gives accounts to show that in winter the ruffed
grouse is known to eat leaves of laurel, which have poisonous
properties, and that there are stories of serious poisoning
resulting from eating the flesh of the birds. Such
poisoning, Forbush points out, seems to have taken place
only long ago and only by winter-taken birds. Perhaps now
that it is illegal to shoot grouse in the winter when they
may have been feeding on laurel, such poisoning does not
occur. This seems an additional reason for obeying the
game laws.</p>

<p>Pigeons in the tropics are abundant both as to individuals
and as to species and many are favored as food.
However, Messrs. D. L. Serventy and H. M. Mitchell, in
their recent volume on the birds of Western Australia, report
that bronze-wing pigeons of two species are given to
feeding on the seeds of the box-poison plant, and when
they have been feeding on these seeds their entrails and
bones, but not the flesh, are poisonous to dogs and cats.
The effects of eating this poison seems to be that the dogs
and cats have fits, become mad, bite at anyone within
reach, and finally die in convulsions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">- 142 -</span></p>

<p>During Colonel Meinertzhagen's study of the birds of
Mauritius he found that one of the pigeons there had a bad
reputation from a culinary point of view. Reports have it
that some of the people who have eaten the flesh of this
pigeon suffered from extreme lassitude, while others reported
the effects as convulsions. Strangely some of the
people who reported sickness from eating this pigeon say
it tastes well, while others who have eaten it without ill
effects say that the flesh is bitter.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What color</span> is the kingfisher? Not the American one, but
the European and Asiatic one? My husband is painting
one and needs to know the colors," a lady's voice came
over the telephone. I thought quickly. "Will it help if I explain
the various kinds and colors of kingfishers and where
they live? But no, lessons on taxonomy and zoogeography
fall too flat most of the time." The lady's voice had a Central
European quality. To her "the kingfisher" probably
meant the little sparrow-sized kingfisher of the Old World
scientists know as <i>Alcedo atthis</i>. So I'd better start with
that. I described the cobalt-blue back, with darker wings,
and dark bars on the crown; an earth-brown stripe through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">- 144 -</span>
the side of the head, paling to whitish posteriorly, and
with ocherous underparts.</p>

<p>"What color is the eye?"</p>

<p>"Brown."</p>

<p>"And the feet?"</p>

<p>"Red."</p>

<p>"And the nails?"</p>

<p>"Black."</p>

<p>She thanked me prettily. I tried to tell her about some
of the other kingfishers, but she said no, she had enough,
and hung up.</p>

<p>I sighed and thought regretfully of all the other things
I had ready to tell her.</p>

<p>In the United States we think of the kingfisher as the
belted kingfisher, larger than a jay, with a tousled crest
and a voice like a watchman's rattle. But there are other
species farther south in the Americas, and in the Old
World there are still more. The tropics are their home.
Only one species reaches Northern United States, and only
one reaches Britain. But in New Guinea, for instance,
there are about twenty-four of the ninety or so known
kinds of kingfishers; the smallest tiny as a warbler, the
largest nearly crow size.</p>

<p>Kingfishers, we call them, but many live on the dry land,
and instead of catching fish catch insects or other tiny
animals from the ground. One large species, with a broad
shovel-like bill, is even reputed to dig in the earth to get
its food of earthworms.</p>

<p>They all look much alike in shape. Once you overcome
your surprise at seeing a kingfisher as big as a crow, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">- 145 -</span>
smaller than a sparrow, you recognize one anywhere&mdash;big-headed,
large-billed birds with tiny feet that sit up quietly
much of the time. Blue is a common color, but not all are
blue. Some are generally reddish in color, some patterned
with browns, grays, and whites tinged with blue. Many
are decorated with crests, and a few species have elongated
spatulate-tipped central tail feathers that have
earned the species the name paradise kingfishers.</p>

<p>Its voice has given one species its name: the laughing
jackass, the jackass kingfisher, or the kookaburra of Australia.
"Ha ha huh huh ho ha ha huk" in a deafening chorus
has been given as a description of its call. A. H. S. Lucas
and W. H. D. Le Sou&euml;f, no doubt with tongue in cheek,
record that "<i>on dit</i> that the jackass has been heard to laugh
while a cicada [it had eaten whole] has been skirring inside
him."</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">CLASSICAL ALLUSIONS</span> Halcyon, Alcyone, and
Ceyx appear in the scientific names of kingfishers. Scientific
names make the layman shudder. Latin, he says, and
if he's told they're not Latin, but rather Greek, it doesn't
help any. But once you know the story of Halcyon (or
Alcyone) and Ceyx, the names stick in your mind. In ancient
times Halcyon was the daughter of Aeolus. And in
grief for her drowned husband, Ceyx, she threw herself
into the sea. The gods, out of compassion, changed both
into kingfishers. Halcyon was also used by the Greeks as a
name for the kingfisher and it was fabled to make its nest
on the sea, and to quiet the waves for its incubation period.
Poets still use Halcyon for the kingfishers in reference to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">- 146 -</span>
calm, happy, peaceful days, Halcyon days; the sort of days
in which the kingfishers can nest on the quiet waves.</p>

<p>The lady had not waited for all this. She had gone. I
would have liked to see the picture her husband was painting
when it was finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he lock ness monster</span> reappears periodically in the
newspapers. This monster seems to belong in the general
category of "sea serpent." As a museum zoologist I've had
little to do with such things. The stock in trade of a
museum is specimens and if someone sends us a "sea serpent"
(and I don't mean a water snake or a sea snake),
we'll identify it. If it doesn't have a name we'll give it one
and make a place for it in our classification. Until then we
are aloof. We've had some little experience at times with
"sea serpents" and the following will illustrate the sort of
investigation and the results that we've had.</p>

<p>Years ago Sir Frederick Jackson was an administrator
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">- 148 -</span>
in East Africa. In addition to his official duties he was an
enthusiastic and an able naturalist. So when a "sea serpent"
was reported there he investigated.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">IN KENYA</span> The sea serpent was said to frequent Lake
Naivasha in the Rift Valley of Kenya Colony. Up until
1909 there were many rumors of it, and Europeans had
seen it with their own eyes. It always appeared on the lake
about the same time each day, about five o'clock in the
afternoon, always about the same distance from the shore,
and was always traveling in the same direction, from
north to south. All descriptions agreed that it was long,
black, and reptilelike, and that it kept appearing and disappearing
on the surface of the water at short intervals.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick kept watch with one of the people who
had reported it. And, sure enough, what appeared like a
long black reptile appearing and disappearing, or like a
school of porpoises, rising and disappearing, came into
view. But Sir Frederick had binoculars and was able to
make out that what to other people had been a long black
reptile was in reality a long line of white-breasted cormorants
in flight, on their way to their roosting quarters. As
they flapped steadily along they were plainly evident, to
the naked eye, as a moving black line; as they paused in
their flapping and sailed on motionless wings they became
invisible to the naked eye, though, of course, still visible
through the binoculars.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">IN NEW GUINEA</span> Once, for a few startled moments, I
thought I had a sea serpent before my very eyes. It was
on the middle Fly River in south New Guinea. We were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">- 149 -</span>
camped on a bamboo-covered bluff overlooking the river.
Though about one hundred miles from the mouth, the
tide made itself strongly felt here, and there was an
abundance of driftwood. This driftwood, varying from
freshly uprooted trees that had fallen into the river to
waterlogged timber that had been long in the river, went
up and down on the tide until it got out in the main
channel and so on to the sea. One day at lunch, sitting in
front of my tent, I was idly watching the driftwood. One
piece in particular caught my fancy. Apparently it was
the root of a partly submerged log, projecting about three
feet above the water, and curved at the end so that it
looked like the neck and head of a reptile with a casque on
its head. Knowing it was a waterworn root, in fancy I even
saw its eye. I called my companion's attention to it, as here
was as close as we were ever likely to get to a sea serpent.
Then, the "head" turned. It was alive. For a few startled
moments it was a sea serpent. You can imagine our amazement
at having a piece of driftwood that we had in fancy
turned into a sea serpent come to life. Investigation became
the order of the day. The binoculars that were constantly
at hand were trained on it. The reality came as a
further surprise. Our sea serpent was the head and shoulders
of a cassowary which was swimming the river. Later
I found that these large, ostrichlike birds, which have a
large casque on their heads, are well known to swim, but
I didn't then.</p>

<p>This seemed an ideal opportunity to collect a specimen.
These birds may weigh up to 150 pounds. When shot in
the forest there is the question of lugging them perhaps
miles to camp. Here was one swimming up to our door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">- 150 -</span></p>

<p>We sat quietly waiting for it. But our native boys had
seen it too, for next I saw them rowing the dinghy to it.
An oar was brought into play to stun it. And then both the
boys and ourselves found out something else. Dead cassowaries
sink. When the bird was stunned by a blow of an
oar, it disappeared below the surface and was never seen
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">R</span>ichard Orr</span>, the <i>Tribune</i> reporter, called me one day
about bronze grackles. It seems that the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>,
in their "Day by Day on the Farm," had told about the
grackles on the <i>Tribune</i> farm. A <i>Tribune</i> reader wrote in,
expressing surprise that grackles were permitted on the
<i>Tribune</i> farm and gave details of destruction by grackles
of other birds, personally observed. What were the facts
of the case? Should grackles be tolerated? Or should they
be eliminated? Orr wanted to know.</p>

<p>This is the sort of question that is difficult. It is important,
too, for it involves basic conservation issues. And
there is no sharp, clear-cut yes-or-no answer. The question
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">- 152 -</span>
as to the grackle's character reminds me of the character
of Moses, as explained when I was in school by a
professor of the Bible: The black was there and the white
was there; Moses was a character sketch in gray. And so
with most creatures. They're both good and bad from our
standpoint. Grackles certainly do kill other birds at times,
and interrupt the nesting of some of our favorite songbirds.
And yet, liking birds as I do, I tolerate them in my
garden. On a trumpet vine on our garage in Chesterton,
Indiana, one year we had a grackle build its nest on top
of a domed English-sparrow nest. The young of both
sparrows and grackles hatched about the same time, and
the two families, within six inches of each other, were
successfully raised without friction between the parents.</p>

<p>Quite evidently grackles are not always killers of other
birds. As to robins or grackles being the "better" birds, if
we had a robin's nest that we prized, and the grackle killed
the young in it, the grackle would be "bad." But if we were
an inquiring farmer, and had to weigh the grackle against
the robin, we might find the grackle "good" and the robin
"bad." The grackle feeds its young vast quantities of insects
harmful to the gardener; the robin sometimes seems
to specialize in earthworms. Earthworms are beneficial to
man, passing through the earth, making air and water
more accessible, and, by passing earth and vegetable matter
through their intestines, enrich the soil.</p>

<p>The house wren that warned the <i>Tribune</i> reader when
the grackles were about is often prized as a garden bird;
it is bold, saucy in appearance, and a vigorous songster.
But it is also well known as a quarrelsome bird, prone to
punch holes in the eggs of its neighbors, and it also may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">- 153 -</span>
fill up with sticks nesting boxes so that other birds cannot
use them.</p>

<p>The above was the gist of what I told Orr, and appeared
in the May 5, 1950, <i>Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>Thinking of it afterwards, as is usual, I thought of many
other things I could have said, and perhaps made more
clear that no bird is all good or all bad, from our human
point of view. Their relationships with the rest of the landscape
are complex. I like to see butterflies flit about my
garden. But butterflies are caterpillars at one stage. And
caterpillars may eat some of the things in my garden.
But some birds feed on caterpillars. If I eliminate the
caterpillars because they eat the plants I like, at one stroke
I eliminate the source of the butterflies I like, and food for
some birds I also like.</p>

<p>Perhaps the partial answer, if answer there be in this
imperfect world, is summed up by moderation: I can have
some butterflies, some caterpillars, some plants, and some
birds in my garden. If one becomes too abundant and interferes
with the others, I prune it. Maintaining some sort
of a balance, we can have some of each.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">W</span>e not only wash</span> ourselves and our clothes, but certain
items of our food are regularly washed, as spinach, to get
the sand out of it. Washing has been so important in our
society that we've coined the term "Cleanliness is next
to godliness." Possibly we've the snobbish idea it's a
strictly human trait. Among other animals we don't expect
to find water used for such cleanliness, and the
raccoon, who does wash his food, is considered a sort of
biological oddity.</p>

<p>But when we come to birds we find a surprising number
of them that wash their food.</p>

<p>The dipper of our Western mountains in Oregon has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">- 155 -</span>
been seen to wash insects and grubs before feeding them
to the young birds. The parents held the food crosswise in
the bill and the head was twisted rapidly from side to
side in the water. Not until then was the food taken to the
nest for the young.</p>

<p>The scene shifts to Africa. Four buff-backed herons
were feeding on a flooded lawn at Gezira, Egypt. One of
the birds captured a large insect, apparently a large black
beetle. Holding the insect in the tip of its bill, the bird
walked to the water, immersed the beetle three times,
shaking and fumbling with it the while, and then swallowing
it.</p>

<p>Then in Britain came a whole host of records, after an
observation in Holland in 1946 of curlew sandpipers washing
food. The birds were probing the dry mud at the edge
of a little creek. When one of the birds got a small sand
worm, it at once ran with quick steps to the creek and
stepped into the shallow water, where it dipped the
worm a few times into the water before swallowing
it. Then it trotted away for more. The editor of <i>British
Birds</i>, the journal in which this was published, suggested
that this might be a more common habit than the scanty
published records would indicate, and invited observations.</p>

<p>A spate of records resulted in the succeeding numbers
of the journal: a whimbrel washing crabs; a snipe, earthworms;
godwits washing their food; with curlews it was
reported to be normal; dunlins, greenshanks, redshanks,
ringed plover, and oyster catchers were all reported doing
this until it appears that with the group of birds we call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">- 156 -</span>
shore birds&mdash;sandpipers, snipes, plovers, and their relatives&mdash;it
may indeed be normal. The details of the observations
strongly suggest that the reason for the washing, in
many cases at least, is the same one that underlies our
washing spinach; to get the sand and mud out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">W</span>hen in El Salvador</span> in 1951, I found that the common
barnyard animals had much the same voices as the ones
with which I was familiar in the United States. But when
I saw their utterances written down it was another matter.
The voices written in Spanish sometimes looked as different
as the names of the animals written in Spanish.
Take the donkey, for example (or <i>burro</i>, as they call it in
Spanish). In English we call its "song" "Heehaw!" In
Spanish they wrote it for me, "Aja! Aja! Ija! Ija!" There
were a number of German scientists at the Instituto Tropical
de Investigaciones Cient&iacute;ficas, where I was working,
and for comparison I asked them to write for me what the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">- 158 -</span>
same animals said in German. The burro (<i>Esel</i>, they call
it in German) says, "<i>Ih&aring;! Ih&aring;!</i>" in German. Despite the difference
in the appearance of these words, when they were
pronounced by the various nationalities they sounded very
similar. Compared with the original assinine pronunciation,
the Spanish version was awarded the prize for being
the best rendition of the beast's voice.</p>

<p>The cat's "<i>Miau, miau, miau</i>" in Spanish, "<i>Miau, miau</i>"
in German, and "Meow" in English were all very similar in
appearance as well as sound. The duck's voice came out
differently. In Spanish it was "<i>Cu&aacute;, cu&aacute;, cu&aacute;</i>," in German
"<i>Wack, wack</i>," and in English the initial "Cu" or "Q" sound
of the Spanish, and the final "k" sound of the German are
united into "quack." The hoot owl came out much the
same in pronunciation, though it looked different in the
Spanish "<i>Ju</i>," in German "<i>Hu</i>," and in English "Who."</p>

<p>The cow's, the pig's, and the frog's voices were also
rather similar in the three languages: the cow's in Spanish
being "<i>Meu, meu, muuu</i>," in German "<i>M&#365;h, m&#365;h</i>," and in
English "Moo"; the pig's "<i>Grup-grup, wink</i>," "<i>&Oacute;&#365;ik, &Oacute;&#365;ik</i>,"
and "Grunt, oink"; and the frog's "<i>Cruac, croac, croac</i>"
"<i>Quak, quak</i>," and "Croak." The barnyard rooster has a
difficult voice to transcribe in letters. In Spanish it was
"<i>Quiquiriguiiii</i>," in German "<i>Kickeriki</i>," and in English
"Cock-a-doodle-do." After listening to the various renditions
by the various nations I could see how each rendition
came into being, but as for deciding which was
closest to the original I hesitated to choose.</p>

<p>When it came to the dog, the discrepancy was surprising:
in Spanish it was "<i>Gu&aacute;n, gu&aacute;n, gu&aacute;n</i>," in German
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">- 159 -</span>
"<i>Wa&#365;, wa&#365;</i>," and in English "Bowwow." The German and
the English are close enough. But though I went outside
and listened to the dogs in Salvador, never did they seem
to say, "<i>Gu&aacute;n, gu&aacute;n, gu&aacute;n</i>," though I must admit that
neither did they seem to say, "Bowwow."</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">S</span>ometimes</span> when I'm trying to decide whether the birds
of the Cameroon Mountains of West Africa are the result
of one invasion and variation <i>in situ</i>, or of two invasions, or
whether the Himalayan red-billed choughs of Ladak are
different from those of Nepal, or how the molt of the
cassowary resembles that of penguins, I am called to the
telephone to identify a bird someone has seen.</p>

<p>The chances are it's a starling. I've not kept a record,
but I fancy half the questions are on identification of
starlings. In the distance starlings are black, and people
know them. But close up, where details can be seen, they
puzzle people with their variety. The young may be dull
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">- 161 -</span>
brownish; the adults may be speckled in the winter; in the
spring the speckled tips of the feathers wear off and they're
all black. But the black is iridescent, and in sunshine glitters
purple or greenish. And the bill color changes too: it
becomes yellow in the spring.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's surprising how you can spot a bird from a
brief description. Take this one: a bird that sits with its
stomach on the ground, and has a big mouth, and long
whiskers; a whippoorwill obviously. Or take this one: a bill
like a chicken and with flat feet at the back; obviously a
pied-billed grebe.</p>

<p>There was one that absolutely stumped me for a day.
The lady said it had a bill like an eagle, and a tail that
stuck up. For the rest she was vague. Often habits, actions,
or habitat are a help to me in placing a bird, but I could
get nothing to help&mdash;not even where she had seen it. I admitted
I couldn't help her. The next day someone brought
in a picture puzzle out of a newspaper, and there, right
in the center, was my bird. It was a dodo! We don't mind
helping people learn things, indeed we consider it part of
our job, but to help them work puzzles is too much!</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">MY LESSON</span> Sight identifications of most students probably
contain errors. On common species it's not important,
as quantitatively they cancel out. But when a bird tripper,
anxious to make a new record, wants me to help him decide
he saw an exotic tern, I'm very careful&mdash;I've had
experience. Rarities have to be checked on all points, not
identified by elimination or on a few key characters. One
of the best lessons of caution I had in New Guinea. It was
in the mountains. Each morning I hunted in a forest where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">- 162 -</span>
I'd found a new genus of bowerbird. Anything might
occur, I thought. Then I saw flying through the treetops
what could only be a magpie. A long-tailed, black and
white bird, its pattern was unmistakable. There was nothing
like it known from New Guinea. It would be an extension
of range from Asia. Or it was a new and unknown
species. Anyway I needed it as a specimen. But it was
shy and eluded me. Morning after morning I haunted the
forest. Finally I got the bird. And it turned out to be a
partly albinistic specimen of a common, black, long-tailed
bird of paradise. The abnormal white areas in its plumage
had fooled me completely. But it helped teach me caution
as to sight identifications.</p>

<p>One of my Gary friends, Mr. Raymond Grow, who is a
keen bird student, has the proper approach, as his identification
of a winter duck showed. There were a number
of unusual winter birds that season (1951-52): brown-headed
chickadees, pine and evening grosbeaks, and red-breasted
nuthatches, all from the North, were present.
It was the sort of winter one expects other rarities from
the North.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">DUCK CAUSES CONFUSION</span> Mr. Grow had seen at
the edge of Lake Michigan a duck he didn't know; it was
boldly patterned in black and white, a big duck. An immature
male eider seemed the only possibility. He came
into the museum and we went over specimens, noting
the difference in the shape of the head between the king
and the common eider. He studied the descriptions and
the plates. Nothing quite fitted. Unsatisfied, he went back
to Michigan City, found the duck again, and suddenly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">- 163 -</span>
realized it was a muscovy duck, partly albinistic, and escaped
from someone's barnyard.</p>

<p>It's not the first time a muscovy has caused confusion.
Only a year or so ago we had a duck sent us from the Philippines
that our correspondent wrote was shot swimming
in a river with a Philippine mallard and surely represented
a new species. But it turned out to be a muscovy whose
original home is tropical American but has become domesticated
and transported by man to far parts of the globe.
Occasionally birds escape and take to the wild, even as this
Philippine bird had done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">S</span>ometimes</span> in "working out" a bird collection things get
dull. In identifying the specimens, and writing down why
they are this species, or that species, or subspecies, it seems
routine; as though it were simply routine putting things
in the categories ready for them.</p>

<p>Such was my feeling one day as I worked over Himalayan
jays and magpies from Nepal. I'd done the yellow-billed
blue magpie, and the red-billed blue magpie, which
both fell into their places smoothly. Then I got out the
literature, the pertinent keys, and descriptions for the next
species, the green hunting jay. It's a beautiful, pale, apple-green
bird, with a green crest, and set off by dark red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">- 165 -</span>
wings. It checked with the descriptions, and I wrote <i>Kitta
chinensis</i>, its scientific name, on the label. Then, to check
the species' identification and to determine the subspecies,
I turned to the collection, to the birds from India,
Siam, and north Indochina, which should all be the same.</p>

<p>I pulled out the drawer&mdash;and blinked at the jays, rows
of them; all pale blue with brown wings. I looked at the
name on the case, on the tray, and the name on each specimen.
They all said the same, <i>Kitta chinensis chinensis</i>, and
it was the bird described as green, like my new specimen.
It was uncanny. The new green specimens and the old
blue ones were identical in size, in structure of bill, crest,
feet, tail; they must be the same. And they were. The book,
I found, described how the colors changed with age, and
in John Gould's magnificently illustrated folio, <i>Birds of
Asia</i>, published in 1861, he had the green hunting jay depicted
both as a green bird with red wings and, in the background,
a "blue" green hunting jay like our museum specimens.
When alive, and when freshly killed, the birds are
green. But with the passing of time the green changes to
pale blue, and the red wings to brown wings. Probably
my new specimen, now a year old, is less green than it was
when fresh. And when twenty years old, like our museum
skins, it will be blue too.</p>

<p>The riddle was solved, and it fits into a well-known
phenomenon, "museum age" or post-mortem change. "Foxing,"
we call it for short. We see it in the male American
merganser, where the lovely rich salmon color of the fresh
bird becomes plain white. The emerald cuckoo of Africa
has vivid rich yellow under parts when fresh, and this too
becomes dingy white. Gray Canada jays become more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">- 166 -</span>
brownish. Birds that are olive or other shades of green tend
to become more olive; brown birds tend to become more
russet or foxy (hence the term "foxing"). We keep all our
specimens in dustproof, lightproof metal cases. The change
is not caused by fading. Apparently it's a change in the
pigment, perhaps from oxidation.</p>

<p>Taxonomists, the men who classify and name birds, have
been fooled by it. Old skins used to represent the birds of
an area may give a quite different idea of what they are
like than do fresh skins, and when skins of different age are
compared, the conclusions may be wrong.</p>

<p>Foxing is one of the pitfalls for the unwary taxonomist,
and something he has to guard against.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he sportsman</span> out for quail or woodcock uses dogs to
drive out the birds for him. Starlings and cowbirds about
Chicago use the same principle in hunting grasshoppers.
Instead of dogs they use cows, though of course the cows
are intent on something else and presumably unconscious
of the fact that they're helping the birds.</p>

<p>As the cow grazes slowly across a meadow, it scares up
grasshoppers close in front of it. The cowbirds and starlings
take advantage of this. Instead of covering the meadow
on foot, constantly alert for a sitting grasshopper, or to
chase one they flush, the birds keep with a grazing cow.
They take up a position by the head, or a foot, and catch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">- 168 -</span>
the insects the cow disturbs. The cow is so much larger
than the bird that it is likely to flush more insects. The
grasshoppers on the wing are much easier to see than when
at rest in the concealing grass, and some fly directly toward
the bird. Too, the grasshoppers fleeing a cow are less
likely to be alert to other dangers.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">CONFIRMED BY OBSERVATION</span> The advantages of
this to the bird are obvious. But we've just assumed they
were, and we had no data on the relative efficiency of the
two methods of hunting. A few years ago, however, while
in El Salvador, I was able to get quantitative data proving
that using a cow as a beater was advantageous, as we suspected,
and showing how much more effective it was,
something we did not know.</p>

<p>The bird concerned was not the starling, which does not
occur there, or a cowbird, which occurs but consorts little
with cows, but was the grove-billed ani, a black cuckoo
about twelve inches long of the tropics of Central and
South America. Like our starling and our cowbird, it kept
with cows, catching the grasshoppers and other insects
that flew up. Both anis and cows were common in the
grassy fields about our headquarters in San Salvador. We
decided, my son Stanley and I, to watch anis with cows for
a few hours, and then without cows for a few hours; thus
getting the average rate for each type of feeding. We
quickly found it wasn't as easy as that. Something always
happened; even on the levelest and most open fields the
birds were constantly disappearing behind a tuft of grass,
or in a hollow, or, if nothing else, behind the cow's head
or feet. Then, too, the ani we elected to watch wouldn't pay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">- 169 -</span>
attention to the job in hand. It would wander off, or go to
sleep. And sometimes, when we were about to discontinue
watching a somnolent bird, it would snap up an insect.
Perhaps it had been watching all the time. Finally we
found we had to record observations of many short periods,
of from three to fourteen minutes each, and add them together.</p>

<p>By dint of much patient watching we got our data. In
the dry season when insects were scarce and the grass
short, it took an ani, hunting alone, two minutes on the
average to find an insect. In the same length of time hunting
with a cow the catch averaged three insects. Thus
hunting with a cow as a beater was three times as effective
as hunting alone.</p>

<p>The effect of the change of the season in abundance of
food for the ani was very striking. In the wet season the
grass began to grow fast, and insects became common.
Then the anis had an easy time. Without a cow an ani
averaged between three and four insects a minute, more
than six times as much as in the dry times. There was less
incentive to use a cow as a beater, with food so abundant,
but when the ani did so, its rate of finding insects was still
higher: between four and five insects per minute. In a table
it looks like this:</p>


<p class="tdc"><i>Average Number of Insects Per Minute Found by Ani Feeding</i></p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdc smaller">WITHOUT COW</td>
  <td class="tdc smaller">WITH COW</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Dry Season</td>
  <td class="tdr">.5</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Wet Season</td>
  <td class="tdr">3.4</td>
  <td class="tdr">4.7</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But the three-times-greater-results in a given time in the
dry season do not tell the whole story as to the effectiveness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">- 170 -</span>
of using a beater. When an ani was hunting by itself
it walked about, covering a surprisingly large amount of
ground. When using a cow as a beater, not only did it
catch more insects in a given length of time, but it also
walked about much less, saving a great deal of energy.</p>

<p>This is not true co-operation between cow and bird, for
they're not working together toward a common end. It's
not exploitation of the cow by the birds, for the cows lose
nothing. It is closer to a form of harmless parasitism, for
the ani profits from the activities of the cow without either
harming or helping the cow. It also illustrates how sharp
birds are&mdash;ready to take advantage of any factor in their
environment that will help them get their food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span> wonder</span> how many of the people who go out making lists
of spring birds know that bird listing goes back to ancient
times. It's a modern sport, but earlier bird watching was
serious, and a competitive listing of birds played a part in
as important an event as the selection of the site of the
city of Rome.</p>

<p>The story, as Plutarch tells it, is that Romulus wanted
the city on what became known as Roma Quadrata; Remus
wanted it on the Aventine Mount. As was the custom in
those days, they concluded at last to decide by a divination
from a flight of birds. The twins placed themselves apart
at some distance and watched. Remus, they say, saw six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">- 172 -</span>
vultures, a truly notable flight; Romulus saw twelve and
from this rare and unusual occurrence Romulus' choice of
the site for the city was accepted.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">VULTURES HIGHLY REGARDED</span> Partly from this the
vulture became chiefly regarded by the Romans in their
divinations from birds. But even before this the vulture
was highly regarded. Hercules, it was said, was always very
joyful when a vulture appeared to him upon any occasion.
He considered it the least harmful of creatures; not pernicious
to corn, fruit tree, or cattle, it never killed or hurt
any living thing. It was also thought not to eat other birds,
a weighty point in its favor, as Plutarch quotes from
Aeschylus, "What bird is clean that preys on fellow bird?"
And apparently its deciding claim to esteem was its rarity
and infrequency, which gave rise to the opinion in some
that it came from another world, an opinion foisted by the
soothsayers of the day.</p>

<p>Earlier yet, birds played a part in Rome's history. Plutarch
warns that some give you mere fables of the origin
of Rome, but it is widely current that Remus and Romulus,
fathered by Mars, the God of War, were exposed in a remote
place to perish. This would have taken place, but for
a she-wolf that nursed them, and birds of various sorts
that brought little morsels of food which they put into
their mouths. Some, however, hold the belief that not birds
of various sorts but a woodpecker was the bird that constantly
fed and watched the twins, and even in Plutarch's
time the Romans still worshiped and honored the woodpecker
for this service to the founder of the city.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span> used to think</span> that the battle of the sexes so ably portrayed
by James Thurber was artificial, a man- and/or
woman-made thing. But recently I've come to see it as old&mdash;probably
as old as sex itself in the animal world.</p>

<p>Under the severe tide, "Secondary Sexual Characters and
Ecological Competition," in a paper from the Bird Division
of the Chicago Museum, I've outlined the possibility of
competition for food, between the sexes, being a factor in
evolution, responsible in part for characteristics of structure
and traits that distinguish them.</p>

<p>In circles that discuss evolution the idea is current that
food competition is important between species. It may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">- 174 -</span>
even be stated as a rule: two species with the same food
habits cannot live in the same place. Competition drives
one out, unless they have different food habits. These
differences seem especially evident when you look at
closely related species, and they are accomplished in a
variety of ways. A habitat difference is very common. The
long-eared owl hunts in the woods&mdash;its cousin, the short-eared
owl, hunts the meadows; the song sparrow favors the
drier shrubbery while its cousin, the swamp sparrow, lives
in wetter shrubbery.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">THE SIZE FACTOR</span> Sometimes the difference is accomplished
by size; take the downy and hairy woodpeckers
of our wood lots, very similar except that one is larger and
is adapted for larger prey, the other smaller and adapted
for smaller food items. Sometimes they feed differently, as
the Baltimore oriole, which picks flowers and pecks
through their sides, while the orchard oriole probes into
flowers as they hang on the branches. Thus more individuals
of several species live in an area.</p>

<p>When a pair of birds "sets up housekeeping" and starts
"raising a family" they can no longer drift about, looking
for easy living and places where food is plentiful. Their
wanderings are restricted by having a fixed point, the nest,
as their center of interest. Two individuals must draw on
the food supply from an area about the nest. Competition
would be extreme, and, if there were a scarcity, perhaps
critical.</p>

<p>We know how different the sexes may be; how different
the rooster is from the hen in our domestic fowl, or the
drake and the duck in the mallard, or the red male and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">- 175 -</span>
green female of the scarlet tanager. These sexual differences
have mostly correlated with display and mating. But
logically there should be differences in feeding behavior
and adaptations between the sexes.</p>

<p>The basic idea is contained in the old nursery rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jack Sprat could eat no fat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wife could eat no lean;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so between them both,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They licked the platter clean.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The two birds of a mated pair, limited to a single area,
could be expected to have different food preferences or
adaptations for getting it. And we find that there are cases
of this. The most striking is that of the huia from New
Zealand, of which I've written in a Chicago Museum bulletin.
Both sexes have similar food preferences, especially
wood-inhabiting insects, but they get them in different
ways. The male has a short, straight, stout bill for digging
out the wood-boring grubs, woodpecker fashion; the female
has a much longer, slender, and curved bill for probing
into holes for them, creeper fashion. The female may
get grubs in wood too hard for the male to chisel. They
supplement each other.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">DIET VARIATION BY SEX</span> It is possible that further
study may show more sexual differences to have a feeding
advantage; the larger size of female hawks fitting them to
take larger prey; the smaller size of certain female songbirds
fitting them for smaller prey, the smaller bills of female
hornbills, the straight bill of the male western grebe,
and the upturned bill of the female. Perhaps all are of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">- 176 -</span>
advantage to the species in giving each sex slightly different
advantages in getting food.</p>

<p>Selection could have its effect in the populations with
most sexual difference in feeding habits being most successful
in raising and leaving progeny. Thus, slowly, differences
between the sexes would accumulate. However, it
must be kept in mind that this sort of evolution would be
limited. The drifting apart of the sexes would be checked
by the necessity for their coming together periodically for
at least a short period, at nesting time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">W</span>ater</span> is a precious thing in the desert. Without it no life
is possible. When rains come plants spring into vigorous
growth. During the long stretches without rain they rest,
some as seed, while some plants store water in root
systems, or in large trunks. Animals have developed a number
of ways of surviving long dry spells in arid country.</p>

<p>Among mammals the kangaroo rat of our Southwestern
desert seems able to get along without water. This is caused
by an arrangement within the body whereby the necessary
water is manufactured within the animal from other foodstuffs:
metabolic water.</p>

<p>The accessibility of drinking water in a desert may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">- 178 -</span>
the determining factor in whether or not some birds can
survive there. The nests of Gambel's quail must be close
enough to drinking water for the newly hatched young to
walk there, else they perish of thirst. It has been said that
newly hatched chicks of the related valley quail of California
cannot travel more than a few hundred yards from
their hatching places without water. Broods hatched
farther away are doomed to die.</p>

<p>Sand grouse, relatives of the pigeons that have adopted
the general appearance and habits of quail, live in the Old
World, primarily in arid or even desert areas. Where they
occur their daily traveling to water is a well-marked
phenomenon. Their flight is swift and powerful, and
though they may traverse long distances of barren, inhospitable
country to watering places, their punctuality in arriving
at water, morning and evening in some species, is
remarkable.</p>

<p>But what of the young of these desert dwellers that need
water? A most unusual situation exists; indeed it seems to
be unique. The old birds bring water to the young! This
has long been recorded, but as recently as 1921 it has been
questioned. However, Mr. Meade-Waldo's observations on
birds in captivity seem to definitely establish the custom,
and its methods.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">PARENTS CARRY WATER</span> Both birds incubate the
eggs, the male by night, the female by day, and both parents
care for the young. But it is the male only that brings
water to the young. He rubs his breast violently up and
down on the ground, and then, his feathers awry, he gets
into his drinking water and saturates the feathers of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">- 179 -</span>
under parts. Then, in captivity, he would run to the hen,
make a demonstration, whereupon the young would run
out from under her, get under him, and suck the water from
his feathers. This they did by passing the feathers through
their bills, continuing and changing about until the supply
was exhausted. It was found that until the young can fly
they take water in no other way.</p>

<p>This was in captivity. Presumably in the wild the process
is the same, the adult flying with wet under parts from the
water hole to the resting place where the young are under
the care of the female.</p>

<p>The similarity of the young sucking water from the
feathers to young mammals suckling their mother has been
pointed out. But another and a truer similarity exists: that
of the young sand grouse getting water from the feathers,
and young quail getting water from dew-wet leaves in
areas where dew is heavy and there is but little surface
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he best-known stories</span> of animal graveyards are those
of elephants. But when I asked the curator of mammals
about them the answer I got was little better than a snort.
Apparently the evidence for them is so vague that it's little
better than a myth.</p>

<p>But in birds we have a few bits of evidence from far-scattered
places that occasionally such things as graveyards
exist.</p>

<p>In the antarctic Dr. Robert Cushman Murphy found on
the island of South Georgia a place where Johnny penguins
went to die. It was in a lake in a coastal range of hills. The
lake bottom was thickly strewn with scores of penguin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">- 181 -</span>
bodies, all of which had apparently died a natural death.
The icy water, Murphy thought, might preserve them for
years. The hills, away from the sea, seem a surprising place
for the graveyard of such aquatic birds as the penguins, but
it correlates with another peculiarity of their mental makeup.
They like to nest on high land, or at least far from the
sea. The blind instinctiveness of much penguin behavior
is well shown by these birds when there is no high land on
their nesting island. Then they may nest so far from the
beach on which they land that they are close to the water
on the other side. Yet they always returned to the sea by
the long route, never taking the shorter route.</p>

<p>Another aspect of this preference for land distant from
the sea is shown by their behavior when threatened with
danger from man or dog. They flee away from the sea,
back onto the land, when safety for them actually lies in
the sea. Presumably this fixed behavior dates back to the
time when the seal that is called the sea leopard was the
penguin's main enemy. Then the sea held their only danger.
With man's arrival the situation changed, but only
after considerable experience with man do the birds
change this behavior.</p>

<p>Apparently, when the time came for the penguins in this
South Georgia graveyard to die, they followed their age-old
pattern, climbing to the high country and away from
the sea.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">IN A HOLLOW TREE</span> In a hole about eighteen inches
in diameter and twelve feet deep in the trunk of a wych
elm in Hants, England, Ursula M. Grigg reports finding
the bones of at least ninety jackdaws, thirteen starlings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">- 182 -</span>
six green woodpeckers, and twenty-five stock doves. All
the remains were clean, and not much broken or decomposed.
The idea that these bones were the remains of
owls' or other predators' feasts was discarded for a number
of reasons; as was the idea that this had been a natural
trap, the birds entering to roost or nest and being unable
to escape. The most tenable idea seems to be that this was
a favorite roosting place in winter, and that during the
severe weather old and weakened birds, roosting there,
succumbed and added their bodies to this communal grave.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">ON AN ISLAND</span> Another instance comes from the little
Cape Verde Isle of Cima in the South Atlantic. A photograph
in the <i>National Geographic</i> magazine for 1927, Vol.
52, P. 27, has the caption that this island is unique and uninhabited
and covered with the tiny bones of millions of
petrels which in ages past have come here to die. Certainly

plateau of this islet.</p>

<p>Petrels are mostly pelagic birds, coming to the land only
to nest on isolated islets. Can this "graveyard" be merely
the normal accumulation of the bones of the nesting season
mortality, or can it be that the birds actually come
here to die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">B</span>est known</span> of the "gardens" and "animal husbandry" of
the lower animals are those of the ants; the aphis kept by
the ants for the sake of a sweetish secretion, and the underground
fungus garden of the ants. In the vertebrates I
know nothing comparable to this, but we do get a number
of cases where there is a definite relation between the
animals and the growth of vegetation.</p>

<p>It has been said that in the antarctic the nesting colonies
of some penguins are detrimental to the vegetation. The
constant passing and standing of the birds on the limited
areas of soil preclude the growing of vegetation over sufficiently
large areas to be an important factor in hindering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">- 184 -</span>
plant growth. But the reverse is true of the Johnny penguin
in the Falklands, where it is sometimes known as the best
farmer in the country. The Falkland Islands, off southern
South America, are cold, wet, and windy. Sheep raising is
one of the main industries. And the Johnny penguin helps
to provide better pasture for the sheep. The birds nest in
colonies and their droppings help to enrich the land so
that the grass grows taller and richer. Rather than using
the same area for their breeding colony each year the
birds select a new, clean area at the beginning of each
breeding season, so that they improve the ground over a
larger area.</p>

<p>From the arctic comes another example of a relationship
between bird and plant. On the arctic barrens, here and
there, are large boulders, erratics left by the glacier that
covered the land in times past. And on these boulders, and
here only, one finds patches of bright yellow or reddish
lichen known to scientists as <i>Xantheria</i> or <i>Xanthoria</i>. Apparently
its presence is owed to the fact that these boulders
are the lookout places of snowy owls, hawks, and other
birds. Their droppings, falling on the rocks, provide the
nutrient layer necessary for the growth of the lichens. It is
probable that these lichens are transported from place to
place by the birds carrying the soredia on their feet. In
recognition of the close relationship between these lichens
and birds an ecologist has coined the rather formidable
term "ornithocoprophilous" to express the relationship.</p>

<p>Also in the arctic are the arctic-fox gardens. The arctic
fox often makes its burrows in sandy places, and about the
entrance to the burrow accumulate remains of former
meals, fox droppings, and suchlike animal debris. This in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">- 185 -</span>
time enriches the soil and the vegetation there grows taller
and more lush than elsewhere on the barrens. This lush
vegetation attracts the small, mouselike arctic rodents, the
lemmings, that feed on green, succulent vegetation. There
is of course one further step in this chain. One of the important
foods of the arctic fox is the lemming, which he
thus brings to his door by the richer vegetation he unwittingly
causes to occur there. A charming arrangement,
one of the old naturalists called it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>he story</span> is well known, being recorded by Pliny, of how
the poet Aeschylus came to his death through a bird mistaking
his bald head for a rock and dropping a turtle on it.
The bird was evidently the lammergeier or "lamb vulture,"
one of the largest and most magnificent of the Old World
birds of prey; nearly four feet long. In the Atlas Mountains
of North Africa its normal food is turtles, and these it
cracks open, so that it can get at the meat, by carrying
them up into the air and dropping them on a rock. Now it
lives in the Himalayas and in Africa, having been almost
if not completely exterminated from Europe because of its
alleged predation on sheep. Not only turtles but bones are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">- 187 -</span>
treated in the same manner, to get at the marrow. Though
the habit is well known, it is surprising how difficult it is to
find a firsthand description of it. So far I know of only one
description written by an eyewitness. And yet, in East
Africa recently a stony mountaintop was found littered
with broken bones that seemed to be the result of the
lammergeier's habit.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">GULLS DO IT</span> As I have mentioned, gulls open clams
and mussels in this way; and crows, which are among the
most intelligent of birds, do it also. They pick up the
mussels left exposed by the falling tide, fly up above a hard
stretch of beach, a big rock, or a stretch of nearby paved
road, and drop the shellfish there. While in general this
practice is restricted to a few groups of birds, it is practiced
by them in many far parts of the world. The Pacific
gull of Australia, widely separated from its near relatives,
has the same maneuver for opening shellfish as has our
herring gull.</p>

<p>It's hard to understand just how this habit came about.
One can imagine that some birds found it out by accident
when flying about with a stubborn "nut" they were unable
to crack. Or perhaps it was in play they found it. The
raven is known to fly about carrying and dropping things
in play.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">SPARROWS DO IT TOO</span> Often, to find a background
if not an explanation of a habit, we look about to see if
it's used in some other connection. I've already mentioned
the play of some of the crows. Only one other "dropping"
habit has come to my attention, and that is a single record
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">- 188 -</span>
for the very common house sparrow. Edmund Jaeger
writes that in Nebraska, and again in Riverside, California,
he saw house sparrows on gravel roofs, dropping
small stones over the edge. The pebbles, or small bits of
crushed stone, were carried to the edge of the building by
the sparrows, dropped, and as each pebble was dropped
the sparrow turned its head, apparently the better to watch
or listen to the pebble fall and strike. No obvious utility
appeared in these actions. It, too, looked like pastime. Perhaps
there was no better reason behind them than that
behind small children dropping stones down a well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">O</span>f course</span> birds can learn. Indeed there's a trite saying
that no animal has been discovered so low that it cannot
learn. One of the simplest cases of learning is shown by
parts of some experiments I carried out years ago on the
curve-billed thrasher. I had raised a number of these
thrashers by hand, and in connection with finding out
about their tasting abilities I first fed them on the white of
egg, hard-boiled and cut into little squares. They liked it.
Then I soaked more squares of boiled egg white in evil
tasting (to me) formalin. The birds came to the dish, and
also ate them. But after that for a week they refused to eat
such egg white. They had quickly learned to avoid the ill-tasting
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">- 190 -</span></p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BAD-TASTING FOOD</span> Once I hand-raised a barred
owl from a nestling to adulthood. Sometimes getting food
for it was a problem, and upon occasion I fed it frogs,
which it seemed to like well enough. But then came a day
when I fed it a toad. The owl seized the toad at once. Now
toad skin, presumably as a defense weapon of the toad,
secretes a substance irritating to the mucous membranes
of some animals. And this was evidently irritating to the
owl, for it did not hold the toad long in its bill. It spat it
out, and the owl's face gave evidence of disgust. After that
the owl not only refused to take toads, but it also refused
to take frogs such as it had found palatable before. Evidently
frogs looked too much like toads. The learning was
effective, and extended not only to the original object, but
also to other, similar objects.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">BUCKET-DRAWING</span> When in Florida with the Archbold
Expeditions I was studying blue jays. A very simple
but amusing thing that chickadees learn is to sit on a perch
and pull up a little container of food that dangles far below
the perch on a string. Jays, along with crows, are
among the most clever of birds, as I've said before, and I
gave two jays in one cage a chance to learn the trick. In
three days one of the jays was regularly and quickly pulling
up the little bucketlike container and getting its food
from it. The process was simple: the jay reached down,
seized the string in its beak, secured the slack under its
foot, and reached down again for another pull. Sometimes
five separate pulls were needed to raise the food bucket
the eight inches to the perch.</p>

<p>The jays were regularly fed in this manner. Soon I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">- 191 -</span>
noticed that only one of the two birds pulled up the
bucket, though the other also fed from it. In effect one was
depending on the work of the other. After this had gone
on for a month, I wondered if the second jay, which had
never done any of the work, would be able to pull up the
bucket if left alone. Certainly it had had lots of opportunity
to learn by seeing its cage mate go through the
motion. So I left it alone in the cage. This second jay,
despite its chances to learn by observation, took one day
longer to learn how to pull up the bucket of food than had
the first jay. The jays certainly learned the trick quickly
through a trial-and-error process, but simply watching
the process seemed to be of little help in learning it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">I</span>f birds</span> can count, it's a rather rudimentary thing&mdash;perhaps
no more than impressions of the size of groups. The
widely known example showing that birds don't seem to
distinguish between one and two persons is the ruse used
by bird photographers and students of birds who are using
blinds from which to watch the birds at close range.</p>

<p>The hide, or blind, is a little hut built perhaps a few feet
from the nest to be photographed. If the photographer enters
the blind in the sight of the parent birds, and conceals
himself there, the birds who saw him go in will be a long
time in coming to the nest and in resuming their normal
activities. But if the photographer takes a companion with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">- 193 -</span>
him, both go into the blind and conceal themselves, and
then one of them goes away leaving the other concealed,
the bird quickly disregards the intrusion and goes about
its activities as though no one were left in the blind. This
subterfuge has long been used and is very successful. Apparently
the bird is unable to distinguish between the two
people that arrive at the nest and the one only that leaves,
and behaves as if both had gone away.</p>

<p>In my duck-hunting days a duck hunter who used
wooden decoys told me he was sure that there was a certain
number of decoys necessary before they were effective.</p>

<p>The decoys were wooden blocks, carved and painted to
resemble life-sized ducks, weighted to float like them, and
anchored in shallow water in a flock within gunshot range
of the blind in which the duck shooter sat. The idea was
that ducks flying by would see the flock on the water, assume
that here was a safe resting place, and fly in and light,
or attempt to light among them, giving the wild-fowl
gunner an opportunity to shoot the wild birds.</p>

<p>The duck shooter claimed that if less than twenty-five or
thirty decoys were put out in the flock, the setup was much
less effective than if more than twenty-five to thirty decoys
were used. He thought that the ducks could distinguish
between less than twenty-five or thirty and more than
twenty-five to thirty, and favored the latter. Though this
is distinguishing between greater and lesser amounts, it
hardly comes in the category of counting.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">DISTINGUISH "MORE" FROM "LESS"</span> However,
a series of experiments summarized on Page 121 in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">- 194 -</span>
the periodical <i>Bird Banding</i> for 1940 seem to indicate that
birds can distinguish between different numbers of things,
such as peas and numbers of dots. The birds, including
pigeons, parakeets, and jackdaws, were trained either to
choose a certain number of objects under certain circumstances,
or to choose between two quantities of objects
with reward and punishment motivation. It was found that
these birds were able to distinguish up to a maximum of
six. That this is really counting in the human sense of the
term, which is linked with speech or written symbols, is
improbable, but it does indicate, as one would expect, that
birds do at times distinguish between different quantities,
and sometimes with considerable precision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">A</span> young man</span>, giving his best girl a box of chocolates,
and a bird, giving his prospective mate a worm or a berry,
have this in common: they are both practicing courtship
feeding. Further, humans and birds are the only vertebrate
animals that do this.</p>

<p>With birds, during courtship, the female often begs to
be fed by acting like a young bird&mdash;with fluttering wings
and widely gaping mouth. The male normally places the
food he has collected directly in the open mouth of the
female.</p>

<p>The significance of this courtship feeding has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">- 196 -</span>
discussed especially by David Lack, in the scientific journal,
the <i>Auk</i>. It seems that in courtship feeding the food as
such is not of primary importance. The female does not
need the food she is begging for; indeed she may have had
a full meal since her mate, whom she is soliciting, had last
eaten. Perhaps it is of help in maintaining the bond between
the pair during the period that exists before they
have a nest and young to look after. In this connection it
is interesting that with waxwings during courtship feeding
the fruit that the male gives the female may be "handed"
back (by beak) and the food exchanged back and forth.</p>

<p>In looking for significance and correlations in courtship
feeding we find that some species practice courtship feeding
and some do not. And the birds that do practice it are
usually those in which both sexes care for the young. It
might be considered an early, useless appearance of a
habit that later becomes useful when the male feeds the
incubating female and helps feed the young.</p>

<p>This type of behavior, in which an act used elsewhere is
introduced into courtship, is sometimes called "symbolic."
Other such symbolic acts are the preening that sometimes
takes place between a pair of mating birds, and the passing
or the manipulation of nesting material long before
there is a nest to be built.</p>

<p>Some species during courtship go through actions that
resemble courtship feeding except that no food is passed;
the bill touching of the mourning dove and of the waxwing
falls in this category. Perhaps it is incipient courtship
feeding on its way in the long course of evolution, either
upward, to include food, or downward, away from courtship
feeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">- 197 -</span></p>

<p>Their functions seem to be to give something for the
pair to do; something they can share. It helps fill up the
pair's day and keep them together. It is something that
helps strengthen the bond between them, against the day
when both will be working together raising a brood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">M</span>ost birds prey</span> on animals enough weaker than themselves
to be in no danger from their prey; their hunting is
more like that of the gunner after rabbits than that of the
hunter after lions. But there are exceptions.</p>

<p>The great blue heron, armed with a spearheadlike bill,
lives largely on fish. These it spears in the water, stalking
about after them on its long legs, or waiting like a bird on a
Japanese screen, as patient as any fisherman, for its prey
to come within striking distance. The heron's size and its
great bill render it safe from most enemies. But it sometimes
overestimates its ability. Audubon recorded one on
the Florida coast that, standing in deep water, up to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">- 199 -</span>
belly, struck a fish too large for it. The fish dragged the
bird for several yards, now on the surface, now underwater.
Finally, after a severe struggle, the heron freed
itself. It was exhausted, and stood near the shore, head
turned away from the sea. As if, Audubon said, it was
afraid to make another attempt at fish catching.</p>

<p>A more serious encounter for the bird was recorded in
<i>Field and Stream</i> magazine. The heron had caught a shad
about a foot long. He tried to swallow it, but it was too big
to go down. He tried to disgorge it, but the fins of the fish,
acting as barbs, kept it from slipping backwards and out.
The result was death for both bird and fish.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">CAUGHT BY A CLAM</span> The oyster catcher, a large black
and white relative of the sandpiper, feeds on, among other
things, shellfish. Mussels and oysters look like hard nuts to
crack, even with a stout, wedgelike bill such as that of the
oyster catchers. The oyster catcher's favorite feeding times
are when the tide has fallen and the shellfish are first exposed
to the air and before they have closed up their
shells, and again when the tide is rising and the shells are
just beginning to open. The oyster catcher stabs into the
shell, and with its bill cuts the strong adductor muscles
that hold the shells of the bivalves together. The rest is
easy. But a danger lurks here: what about stabbing into
too big a shellfish, or making an inept stab? And this very
thing has happened. On the South Carolina coast Mr.
W. P. Baldwin found a trapped, drowned bird. It was held,
with the tip of its bill caught in the shell of a hard-shell
clam, as if in a trap. Apparently the rising tide had flooded
and drowned the bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">- 200 -</span></p>

<p>The raven eats most anything, living or dead, and except
for man has little to fear in the northern forests where it
lives. Yet from Wisconsin comes a record of one that met
his death through a porcupine. The porcupine's quills are
a dreadfully prickly covering that one would think would
protect it from most encounters. Yet one animal, the fisher,
kills and eats it as a matter of course, and wolves and bears
sometimes eat them without too many ill-effects from the
spines. The slow-moving porcupine has little regard for
automobiles, and many are run over on country roads. A
porcupine is too big and tough for a raven to kill and the
Wisconsin raven had probably fed on a dead porcupine.
Stuck through its gizzard was a quill, and another, which
had apparently caused its death, was stuck in its heart,
having apparently worked there from the digestive tract.</p>

<p>Many small insectivorous birds eat spiders as well as
insects. This they do almost with impunity in temperate
latitudes, where only occasionally do spiders make webs
strong enough to trap a bird. But in the tropics, where
there are more large spiders, their webs must be a greater
hazard to birds. That the hazard exists in both climes,
however, is shown by a goldfinch reported caught in a
spider's web in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and a dusky flycatcher
caught in a spider's web in Cameroons, West
Africa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>o care for</span> the weak, the unfit, and the cripple is
usually considered an extremely highly developed altruism
in our society. As our society progresses, more and
more provisions are made for the unfit.</p>

<p>In nature the unfit usually is soon weeded out. If an
animal is unable to feed itself it is doomed; or if it is less
successful than its fellows it has less chance of leaving
progeny. That is natural selection.</p>

<p>Hence on both counts it comes as a surprise to find
two well-authenticated cases of crippled birds, unable
to search for food for themselves, surviving for long
periods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">- 202 -</span></p>

<p>The first is T. R. Peale's record in 1848 of a brown booby
on Enderby Island in the Pacific. An adult bird whose
plumage indicated it was several years old was found on
the island, and it had only one wing, the other having been
lost by some accident and the wound completely healed.
The bird was unable to go to sea and get its own food, and
was being fed by its fellows.</p>

<p>The second was a frigate bird, found on the Revillagigedo
Islands, reported by A. W. Anthony in 1898.
This bird, too, was fat, and had one wing withered and
useless, evidently from hatching. It had never flown.
Frigate birds are masters of the air that snatch their
food on the wing from the surface of the water, and a
flightless frigate bird would be as badly off as a flightless
swallow. The cripple had been fed all its life by its
neighbors.</p>

<p>At first the uncritical might think, What altruism, what
charity, for the healthy to feed these two cripples. But an
explanation involving less advanced principles, principles
more in keeping with what we know about bird behavior,
is possible. Remember that young birds that are unable to
begin feeding themselves at the proper time may continue
to beg for food, and be dependent for a long time, as I
have shown with young shrikes under the chapter, "Conditioning
in Birds." Remember that a young bird begging
for food may be fed by adults, not its parents, and even by
other young birds (shown in "Bird Helpers at Nesting
Time"); and we have the clue.</p>

<p>The cripples, hungry, begged for food; the healthy birds
responded by feeding, as they might do to other begging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">- 203 -</span>
young, and owing to the unusual circumstances both were
continued.</p>

<p>These certainly are cases where the unfit survived.
Natural selection has not operated. But such cases are rare
exceptions.</p>

museum sometimes has to deal with one whose plumage
is soiled or stained. He may have to wash it with water.
Then, to dry the plumage, fluff it, and help in arranging
the plumage so it will lie smooth and natural, he may use
a powder: corn meal, sawdust, plaster, or plaster and
potato starch may be worked into the feathers, then dusted
out again. It is interesting that birds themselves use and
have used long before taxidermists a similar method of
using dust in dressing their feathers, a fact that anyone
who has watched domestic hens for any length of time
must be aware.</p>

here were dingy, all had their plumage heavily impregnated
with city grime, and looked very different from
the sparrows in the country. And this sparrow I was

<p>This reminded me that Oscar Heinroth once wrote that
birds do not bathe to get themselves clean, but bathe as an
aid in bringing their feathers into order and making them
lie smoothly. Perhaps he is right. Certainly my sparrow did
nothing to clean himself.</p>

<p>It is in arid countries, plains and deserts especially,
where many of the birds take only dust baths. In more
humid regions water bathing is the rule. But some birds do
both, like our flicker and our house sparrow, bathing now
in water, now in sand.</p>

<p>In northern climates, when the land is held in the grip
of winter, the water frozen over, and the earth covered
with snow, neither dust nor water bathing is possible.
Then, it has been recorded, some birds find a substitute in
snow. Among other cases, in Alaska the hawk owl has been
seen to perch in the snow on the tops of telephone poles,
and go through the motions of bathing; in England a rook
was recorded as bathing "in crisp powdery snow as if it
were taking a bath in dust or water"; and in New England
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">- 206 -</span>
in midwinter juncos have been recorded bathing "in light
dry snow, just as other sparrows take dust baths in hot
weather."</p>

<p>The snow evidently is used as a substitute for dust in
these northern latitudes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">T</span>o use</span> a bunch of flowers or a spray of leaves in decorating
a room in a house is a refinement of civilization. As
the flowers fade, or the leaves wilt, they are replaced with
fresh ones. Sometimes a winter bouquet is used that will
serve for months.</p>

<p>There are several birds that habitually deck their nests
with green vegetation, and when it is wilted, it is renewed
with fresh. The reason is not clear. It has been suggested
it is to supply humidity and, by evaporation, coolness; it
has also been suggested that its use serves a sanitary purpose.
But whatever the reason in birds' eyes, it looks like
decoration to human eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">- 208 -</span></p>

<p>This habit is common with a number of different hawks:
for example, the red-tailed hawk is reported sometimes to
have its nest, a bulky flat, basin-shaped structure in the
crotch of a tree, "profusely and beautifully lined with
fresh green sprigs of white pine, which are frequently renewed
during incubation and during the earlier stages in
the growth of the young." The golden eagle is said to add
green grass, or green leaves often attached to the twigs
from time to time to the lining of the nest, especially after
the young are hatched; and the broad-winged hawk is said
to add green leaves to the lining of its nest. In quite another
group of birds the same thing also occurs. A carrion
crow's nest in England was visited periodically from
March to August. Strangely no eggs were laid during this
whole period, but the birds remained in attendance. When
found, fresh sprigs of oak leaves were interwoven around
the rim of the nest. On subsequent visits the oak leaves
were found to have been replaced with fresh ones, and the
leaves were kept fresh until late August.</p>

<p>The purple martin supplies another example. The nest
boxes we put up for them supply their main breeding
places in some areas. "The parents have a habit of collecting
many green leaves and placing them in the nest, a
practice which may tend by evaporation to reduce the
heat" in the next box. "Where large colonies are breeding
they sometimes injure pear trees by stripping certain
branches of their leaves," according to E. H. Forbush.</p>

<p>A Madagascar weaverbird provides an example of decorating
the nest entrance of a quite different type of nest;
in this case the nest is in the shape of an inverted retort,
with the entrance through the spout. The entrance is decorated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">- 209 -</span>
with green grass heads or with green leaves, and the
males keep adding fresh green decorations even when the
eggs are being incubated by the female.</p>

<p>It seems hard to believe that this is really decoration,
that it is not for some purpose&mdash;either connected with the
raising of the young, or more probably a leisure or substitute
activity&mdash;something to keep the bird busy and
strengthen the bond between bird and nest when it is not
otherwise directly occupied with nesting activities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fntsz2">B</span>eing unable</span> to ask birds questions that will receive answers,
we have to judge their motives from appearances.
And from the way some birds act curiosity seems a strong
motivation at times. They show a disposition to inquire
into things, especially strange things.</p>

<p>Young blue jays that I've raised and studied are among
the most prying, investigating, inquisitive birds I've
known. When well fed they devoted much time to examining
things. Humans, of course, would examine objects
by picking them up in their hands, looking at and
feeling them, perhaps tasting them. The jays, with more
limited equipment, would examine them with bill and eye.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">- 211 -</span>
When the jays were very young their toes interested them.
They pecked at and twisted their own and their neighbor's
toes. Pencils and crayons on my desk appeared to interest
them particularly. These they were continually pulling
about and pecking at. They went about picking at lines on
paper, knotholes in the walls of their cage, the red letters
printed on a bottle label, and the buttons on our clothes.
Cigarettes they liked to investigate by pulling them to
pieces. It looked as if the jays were interested in finding
out about the things around them by touch and taste as
much as they could.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="allsmcap">LURED INTO DANGER</span> Compared with jays, ducks
seem rather stolid creatures, but they have curiosity too.
This was well known to the old-time duck hunters who
capitalized on it in duck shooting. The technique is known
as "tolling" and I've used two variations of it in museum
collecting.</p>

<p>Once on a little mountain lake in New Guinea I found a
pair of ducks of a rare species I especially needed for our
collection. I stalked them to the farthest bit of cover I
could reach, a tussock of grass on the lake margin, behind
which I lay concealed. But the ducks were still too far
away for me to reach, and their feeding did not seem to
be drawing them nearer. I remembered the gunners' trick
of tolling, and tried it. I took out my white handkerchief,
held it above the tussock of grass while I kept well hidden,
and waved the handkerchief back and forth. The response
was surprisingly prompt and gratifying. The two ducks
turned at once and swam right in to me so that I secured
them without any trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">- 212 -</span></p>

<p>Once on a lake in central New York State there was a
flock of scaup ducks swimming well offshore. It looked as
if they never would come in near the bank. Quite by accident
a setter dog that accompanied us began to cavort
along the beach. Again the ducks turned and the whole
flock came swimming in. Only then did I remember that
among old-time gunners there was the practice of using a
dog thus, a dog that was even trained for the purpose, to
jump high and run about very conspicuously while the
ducks were far out, and as the ducks came swimming in,
to keep lower and frisk about partly concealed so that the
ducks would have to come close to satisfy their curiosity.</p>

are my own, and some of the accounts on the previous

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
